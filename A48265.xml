            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS ſoon as I began to write the Book, I now preſent you with, My Lord the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> your Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did me the Honour to employ me in your Service, to read Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to you. I was ſurprized with Pleaſure, to obſerve that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God having deſigned me for this Employment, had turned my thoughts upon a Subject; the knowledge of which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for you, that ſo you may
<pb facs="tcp:55474:3"/>reap the full advantage of thoſe wiſe Inſtructions, which your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who loves you tenderly, will one day give you, concerning thoſe extraordinary Revolutions, which <hi>Europe</hi> has with Amazement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held for thirty years together.</p>
            <p>He knows the ſecret Motives and hidden Springs, which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them all; and he has always been the Depoſitary of the Secrets of that Great Prince, who had the greateſt hand in them; he has ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in his brave and hazardous Enterprizes, with equal Zeal and Courage.</p>
            <p>'Tis from a Father ſo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely skill'd in all the Arts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks and War, that you will learn, my Lord, the Intrigues of all the Negotiations, which have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in his time, the preſent Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Princes, the Account of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, Sieges, Marches of Armies, in
<pb facs="tcp:55474:3"/>which he has always held a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Poſt. In giving you the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of his own Actions, he will inſtruct you, how a Perſon of your Rank and Quality, may equally love your Country, and a Prince, who do's you the Honour to truſt you with his Secrets; what Rules you are to obſerve, that ſo you may do good ſervice for the one, without intrenching upon that inviolable fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, which you owe to the other. In ſhort, he will teach you, what a Peer of <hi>England</hi> is obliged to do, that he may be ſerviceable to the King in Parliament, and at the ſame time deſerve the Eſteem and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a People extremely jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of its Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Others beſides, my Lord, the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> may poſſibly be able to give you good Counſel in theſe Affairs. But there is one thing yet behind, which your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Father alone can teach
<pb facs="tcp:55474:4"/>you; And that is, My Lord, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in an elevated Fortune. He has himſelf lately given you a rare example of it. The Greatneſs of his Soul in this reſpect, is a thing ſo extraordinary, that you will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find an equal Inſtance, in all thoſe Ancient and Modern Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which you deſign to read. Keep your Eyes always fixt on this Domeſtick Example. It can't but powerfully impreſs this weighty Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im in your mind, That to ſet bounds to your Ambition, though juſt and reaſonable, is truer and more ſubſtantial Glory, than 'tis to riſe to the higheſt Dignities.</p>
            <p>I have told you my Lord, that the Hiſtory of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>XIII.</hi> will be of great uſe to you, to let you into the underſtanding of thoſe Revolutions, which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for ſome time paſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> You will there ſee how the Affairs of the Empire put on a new face
<pb facs="tcp:55474:4"/>after the Peace of <hi>Munſter;</hi> And there find the cauſes and firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Decay of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Monarchy, which before that time, was dreadful to its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. You will there read the firſt ſteps of <hi>France,</hi> to that height which it arrived at, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the violent and refined Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of a Cardinal, who renders his Maſter powerful at home, by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Princes and great Men there, and formidable abroad, by entring him into a ſeaſonable League with the Crown of <hi>Swedeland</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> The good Correſpondence which the great <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and this able Miniſter held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did not a little aſſiſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, in compaſſing his vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> were hitherto hardly known, but for their Wars againſt <hi>Denmark, Poland, Muſcovy,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:55474:5"/>ſome extraordinary Revolutions, which Religion, or the differing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of King and Subjects had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in <hi>Swedeland.</hi> We ſhall ſee in the courſe of this Hiſtory, a new Warrier ariſing out of the <hi>North</hi> with a ſmall number of Troops, for the Reſcue of <hi>Germany,</hi> almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely enſlav'd by the Ambition and Arms of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second. <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> makes the Emperor Tremble, for fear of loſing his Hereditary Countries. The Rapid courſe of his Victorius Arms carryed to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> makes jealous even thoſe Princes which call'd him to their Aſſiſtance, and thoſe Sovereigns which had deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Alliance. That which you ought particularly to be affected with, My Lord, is the reading of the reſolute Efforts of your Dear and Illuſtrious Country, to defend it's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty after the twelve years Truce was expir'd. The <hi>Spaniard's</hi> pleas'd themſelves with the hopes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:55474:5"/>great Advantages of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which aroſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome other Provinces, after the Concluſion of that Truce. But the Valour and Wiſe Conduct of <hi>Maurice</hi> and <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> defeated thoſe hopes, which ſeem'd to be but too well grounded. You will be very much pleaſed to find here Sieges Form'd by thoſe Two Great Maſters in the Art of Taking Towns, and Victories Won by thoſe Two Famous Generals, to whom they came from all Parts of the World to learn the Art of War; and, in ſhort, That Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, not Inferiour to that of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> with which the <hi>United Provinces</hi> did weary out the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> until he renounc'd all his Pretenſions to 'em, and was forc'd to acknowledge them, in a Solemn Treaty, for a Free Republick.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55474:6"/>
            <p>I believe you have not forgot that which my Lord, your Father, told you in one of his Pleaſant and Profitable Diſcourſes which he had with you the laſt Summer, in the Walks of his beloved Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude near the <hi>Hague.</hi> He reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you one Day the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prince <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> a little before his Death: <hi>That his Poſterity would be under a Neceſſity one Day to declare againſt <hi>France,</hi> as he had been to oppoſe the Ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria. It has fell out as this Judicious and Knowing Politician had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. The Houſe of <hi>Orange</hi> hath had the Honour to have given the firſt Blow, which ſhook the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by a ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Turn of Affairs, the only Remaining Branch of that Noble Stock, which hath been ſo fruitful in Heroes, can glory this Day, that by his Prudence and Valour he
<pb facs="tcp:55474:6"/>hath defended that ſame Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, threatned with approaching Ruin. Could that fierce and bloody <hi>Philip II.</hi> have ever thought that the Poſterity of that Man, whom he had baſely murder'd, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an unworthy and ridiculous Proſcription, ſhould be one Day the beſt Support of his tottering Crown?</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the Reign of <hi>Lewis XIII.</hi> will diſcover to you, my Lord, the Reaſons which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Frederick Henry</hi> had to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the Glory which was reſerv'd for a Great King, the Heir of his Blood and of his Virtues, who gives you already ſignal Marks of his Diſtinguiſhing Favour.</p>
            <p>'Twould be but a ſmall Matter to learn from Hiſtory, The Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Sovereigns, the Accounts of Battles and Sieges, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of Treaties and Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:55474:7"/>the Good or Bad Quality of the different Actors. Its greateſt and principal End is to confirm in you the Good Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, Virtue and Probity, which, my Lord, your Father hath took care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire you with. They charm'd me the firſt Day I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be in your Company; and I bleſs God, with all my Heart, that they appear ſo pure, and ſo deeply engraven in your Soul, that we have all the Reaſon in the World to hope, that the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and inſinuating Air of the Court, and of the World, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to corrupt or wear them out; and that you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wander from the Paths of Piety, Prudence, and Valour, which my Lord, the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> hath trac'd out to you. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens grant, which have deſign'd you to enjoy the great Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which a Father can leave to
<pb facs="tcp:55474:7"/>his Son, that you may make an Uſe of them worthy of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Religion which we profeſs. Theſe are the ardent Deſires of him, who ſhall be, all his Life, with a proſound Reſpect, and inviolable Fidelity,</p>

It would be to no purpoſe to excite the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of the Reader by a like Preface.</hi> All Men are ſenſible that the reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, is the moſt proper means to form the Mind and Inclinations of thoſe who apply themſelves to it, with Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Judgment. They who are born to the firſt employs of the State, learn here how to govern thoſe whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has placed under them; and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons often find Inſtructions for the Conduct of their Lives. To read the Ancients and Moderns, and only fill the Head with a confus'd heap of different Facts, is the vaineſt thing in the World, and conduces moſt to Debauch the Mind. But to run thrô Hiſtory with a deſign to learn Human Nature, to reflect on the Diſorderly and Unjuſt Paſſions of Men; to diſtinguiſh Solid and Real Virtue, from
<pb facs="tcp:55474:9"/>that which conſiſts in the miſtaken Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Multitude; This certainly is the moſt proper Study to form a Man for the World and Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the reading Hiſtory has theſe mighty Advantages, there are few that profit by it. The fate of thoſe who ſpend their time in it, is often the ſame with that of Perſons who Travel, live in a Court, or Converſe in the World. A Man who has the Skill to make a good uſe of his Parts and Reaſon, Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es himſelf very much in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by Converſation with Courtiers, and Men of Buſineſs. But it ordinarily happens, that Travellers only ſeek to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themſelves in the places where they come. A young Fellow returns out of <hi>Italy, France, Germany</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> as ignorant as he went there. And very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in ſtead of correcting his Domeſtick Vices, he encreaſes them, by the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Foreign ones. Moſt Men who come to Court, or into the World, only think how to waſt away their Lives, and ſpend their Time agreeably. Very far from conſidering how private Intereſt and Paſſion, play their parts on the publick Stage, and reaſoning with themſelves o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> read Hiſtory, fall into the ſame Miſtake They only aim to conſume their Time
<pb facs="tcp:55474:9"/>and paſs away the Tedious Hours. It is enough for them, if a Book be Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Diverting. They are never in Pain to profit, by the Examples of Virtue they meet with, or reflect on the Faults of thoſe who are expoſed in it. This Negligence proceeds from the little care taken to acquaint Youth with the Nature of Mankind, and infuſing good Principles of Morality into them, before they are put on reading Hiſtory, ſent into Foreign Countries, or left to live at large in the World. If their Tutors and Governors which had the Charge of their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had accuſtomed them to Meditate on thoſe Remarks, which the Incomparable Author of the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P.

            <p>Perhaps too, the ſmall number of good Authors in this and former Ages, is another cauſe of the little Progreſs made by thoſe who promiſcuouſly run over all, without Choice or Diſtinction. <hi>Herodotus,</hi> whom the Ancients call the <hi>Father of Hiſtory,</hi>

The Hiſtory of <hi>Cyrus</hi> is thought to be a Romance, deviſed by <hi>Xenophon.</hi> I do not know whether the Plan of the Work do not come nearer Truth, than what <hi>Herodotus</hi> delivers of the Birth, Conqueſt and Death of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The one at leaſt, is more probable than the other.

This ſhould make us value the Eight Books of the <hi>Cyropedia</hi> of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> more than the nine of <hi>Herodotus</hi> his Hiſtory, though they have the Name of the nine Muſes given them. This may amuſe me indeed, but the other will inſtruct me.

               <hi>Polybius</hi> mentions ſeveral, who had writ the ſame things as he has done, and cannot find one to ſatisfie him. There are ſeveral Reaſons to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for this. Some ſeek to flatter thoſe, from whom they expect a Reward. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers only aim to divert the Reader, make Books of a quick and ready Sale, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Reputation of Writing with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs and Eaſe.<note place="margin">Cicero <hi>ad famil.</hi> Lib.

We know ſome too, who will have their Hiſtory writ under their own Eyes. What Sincerity, what Truth, what Inſtruction, can we expect from thoſe Authors, who will give us hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or beautiful Pictures, as their Intereſts, Paſſions or Deſire to pleaſe their Patrons or Readers lead them? Beſides, there is ſtill another Reaſon why good Hiſtories have been, and ever will be extreamly rare; becauſe theſe Works ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a great number of excellent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in him, who undertakes them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55474:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> maintains, that a good Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,<note place="margin">Lib. II. <hi>de Oratore.</hi>
               </note> ought to be an excellent Orator. And how many things, good God! do's he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to make a finiſh't Orator?<note place="margin">Lib. X. <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut.</hi> cap. 10.</note>

What Care, what Application muſt a Man uſe, to keep that exact <hi>Medium</hi> of a Style, more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime than that of an Orator, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried into the Dithyrambicks of the Poets. Though theſe two Men were great Judges, I do not know whether their Judgment be a ſure Rule on theſe Occaſions. <hi>Lucian</hi> ſeems to me, to ſpeak more juſtly of the Hiſtorical Stile.<note place="margin">A Diſcourſe of the manner of writing Hiſtory.</note> This Author will have it <hi>clear, intelligible and natural, without being low, and that the Figures, which give a Reliſh to the Diſcourſe, ſhould not be too Sublime, or too far fetcht.</hi> He allows indeed, the Style ſhould ſwell a little on ſome Occaſions, provided the Writer forbear <hi>all Euthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm and Poletick Rage. Exceſſive Strains and Lines,</hi> ſays <hi>Lucian,</hi> are the <hi>two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Faults of an Hiſtorian. If a Writer would riſe, let it rather be by the things he repreſents, than Words. It is much better to relate Extraordinary things in a plain and common manner, than to weaken the Thought by ſtraining the Imagination. I would have the Periods neither too long, nor too much ſtudied; and the Diſcourſe neither too Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous or neglected.</hi> That <hi>the Thoughts ſhould have more Solidity, than Luſtre.
<pb facs="tcp:55474:12"/>That they ſhould come nearer the Reaſons of a Wiſe Stateſman, than the witty Turns of a Declamer. In ſhort, the Sentences muſt not too frequently occur, not be too far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. They ought as it were, to be enchaſed in the Body of the Work. Lucian</hi> requires much leſs than <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Quintilian;</hi> but how difficult is it to reach that juſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, with which he is contented? <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> ſtrove to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves by a Nervous Eloquence, which ſays a great many things in a few Words. But they have made themſelves dark, and often are unintelligible. <hi>Titus Livy</hi> on the contrary, is embaraſſed by his meaſured Periods. By ſeeking to give Number and Harmony to his Diſcourſe, he loſes the weight of what ſhould at firſt be preſented to the Readers View.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polybius</hi> would have an Hiſtorian, to be a great Stateſman. None will ever be capable of Writing an Hiſtory well, ſays he, nor eſcape committing great Faults, till he has gained a Conſummate Prudence by long Uſe, and a great Experience in the Buſineſs of the World. For this reaſon, that Author who himſelf was an excellent Officer in an Army, and States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, wiſhed thoſe who had a ſhare in the Government, and Important Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and knew the Reaſons and Motives of Enterprizes, would apply themſelves in the ſame manner he had done, to give the Hiſtory of their own Times, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decline an Employment ſo profitable
<pb facs="tcp:55474:12"/>and neceſſary to the Publick. <hi>Polybius</hi> his Wiſh was good in a Republick. Men of Eſtates and Letters, being ordinarily employed in theſe ſort of Governments, they are able to relate with more Art and Sincerity, the Affairs they happen to manage, and diſcover to Poſterity, the true Motives of the Enterprizes, and the different Intereſts of all Parties engaged with them. For this Reaſon it is, the Hiſtory of <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> deſerve ſo much to be commended. Their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity ſhines in every line of their Works. The former lived in the time of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſian</hi> War, which he has deſcribed. He had an Employ and Character in the Republick of <hi>Athens,</hi> whoſe Policy and Government he perfectly well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.<note place="margin">Polyb. L. III. &amp; V.</note> The other had been <hi>the Spectator of moſt of the things he relates: He had aſſiſted in the Execution of ſome of them.</hi> In ſhort, he Commanded in Enterprizes, of which himſelf had been the Adviſer. What <hi>Polybius</hi> had not ſeen, he reports from <hi>the Accounts given him by thoſe who had been Eye-witneſſes of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In vain it is to wiſh, the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State would write the Hiſtory of their Times. Theſe Gentlemen entirely, employed in making their Fortunes, think they can beſtow their time better in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing themſelves and their Families. They will be ſure not to give us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and Faithful account of the Intrigues, of the Cabinet and Court, and diſcover
<pb facs="tcp:55474:13"/>to the World the true Motives of Wars, Alliances, and other Enterprizes. Will they publiſh to the World their own Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery and Villanies? Will they ſpeak ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely of the Infamies and Criminal Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a Prince, to whom they owe their Places and Preferments? Will they tell the Artifices they uſed, to flatter or incenſe them, to ruin a Rival of more Merit than themſelves, or advance their own ill-deſerving Creatures? Stateſmen and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſometimes write Memoirs. But theſe are not to be truſted to. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fearing to make a raſh Judgment, I will ſay, theſe Writers of Quality are like certain Perſons, who publiſh'd the Hiſtory of their own Actions in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time. This Man, the vaineſt that ever lived, was even dead with longing to ſee his Conſulat writ by ſome eminent and able Pen.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ad familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> Lib. V. Ep. 12.</note> Diſpleaſed that he could not obtain what he ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly coveted, he was tempted to do as others had done, and to write himſelf the Wonders of that Conſulat, with which he had ſtunn'd the World in his Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Books and Letters. One thing reſtrained him. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he very Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <hi>there are two very great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in being the Hiſtorian of a Man's own Actions. He muſt be too modeſt in his own Praiſes, and diſſemble his Faults, to ſave his Honour.</hi> See here the Condition of all Writers of Memoirs. If Decency requires them not to ſpeak too well of themſelves, their Partiality leads them
<pb facs="tcp:55474:13"/>to conceal, or at leaſt palliate, what they have done amiſs.</p>
            <p>If an Hiſtorian ought to be a Stateſman; for the ſame Reaſon he ought to be skilful in the Art of War. Without this, how ſhall he deſcribe an Incampment, a Siege, or a Battle? If I may freely ſpeak my Thoughts, theſe Particulars are not very neceſſary in a General Hiſtory. This Caution belongs more to a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or the Memoirs of a Man who intends to give Inſtructions to thoſe of his Profeſſion.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> I have heard an eminent Prelate, who has a Noble Genius for writing Hiſtory, as well as for the Pulpit and Divinity ſay, That the late Mr. <hi>de Schombergh,</hi> Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> and after a Duke in <hi>England,</hi> had advis'd him to forbear entring too far into Particulars in Matters of War. <hi>None,</hi> ſaid that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent General, <hi>but the moſt able Men of the Trade can ſpeak well of theſe things.</hi> It is almoſt impoſſible to know exactly all the Circumſtances of an Action. The General gives Orders, and after is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what paſſes. The Inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers muſt give an Account of what they do themſelves. It is reaſonable to believe the Memoirs <hi>Caeſar</hi> has left to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhould have the utmoſt Exactneſs: Yet there were ſome Men in his time, who did not exceedingly rely on them. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaid they,<note place="margin">Suetonius in Julio Caeſare cap. 56.</note> 
               <hi>too lightly gave credit to what was reported to him of other Mens Actions, and is not very faithful in what he
<pb facs="tcp:55474:14"/>relates of his own; either becauſe his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory deceiv'd him, or he would not ſincerely ſpeak the Truth.</hi> Since it is difficult to learn all the Circumſtances of a Battle, where things on both ſides are in great Confuſion, an Hiſtorian may be excuſed, if he do not inform us of all Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. He may deſcribe more exactly a March, an Incampment, or a Siege: But of what uſe is this at bottom? Few have any Intereſt here, except thoſe of the Trade. The Buſineſs of Hiſtory is more to form a Gentleman than to inſtruct a Soldier or an Officer. Theſe Reaſons have prevailed with me to think I may undertake to write the Hiſtory of a Reign, which contains a great number of Sieges and Battles, though I underſtand nothing of the Military Art.</p>
            <p>I have not more Experience in Affairs of State, or Court Intrigues: This is true. But on the other Hand, I do not relate the Actions of my own time.

For my part I will not diſſemble, I have not yet procured any of thoſe rare and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memoirs. After the Example of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who compiled their Hiſtories out of the Works of thoſe who writ before them, I have carefully col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the beſt Things I could find in the Country where I reſide, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd out of them a continued Hiſtory of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. in the moſt uſeful and inſtructive manner I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>I have taken that part of the Annals of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which yet remains for my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; not for the Stile, or that myſterious Air which he affects in every thing he ſpeaks of, but in the Deſign and Plan of the Work.

<pb facs="tcp:55474:15"/>of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> And my chief Aim is to ſhew the Practices after the Death of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV. to deſtory the little remaining Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>France,</hi> to oppreſs the Clergy, the Nobility, and People; in ſhort, to lay the Foundations of an enormous Power, which has ſtruck a Terrour into all <hi>Europe</hi> in our Days. Perhaps ſome will reproach me, that if I want the Strength and the Sententious Stile of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> at leaſt I have imitated his Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Some charge him with giving an ill Turn to all the Actions of thoſe he ſpeaks of, and finding no Virtue and Probity any where. But not to ſay how ſmall the number of the Good is, when a Man is obliged to bring on the Stage ambitious Men, who ſacrifice all to their Riſe, and Fortunes: Baſe and flattering Courtiers, who make no Scruple of betray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing their Religion and Country; Can he give theſe Actors the Part of an honeſt Man? All that can be reaſonably required of an Hiſtorian is, that Men being rarely entirely corrupt and wicked, he ſhould not conceal what is good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where he finds it in the worſt.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:55474:15"/>had good Reaſon to blame a <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who had not Equity enough to own what was good in <hi>Agathocles</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſe.

                  </gap>ſs the Potent Republick of</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, <hi>and die in the peaceful Poſſeſſion of what he had acquired, it cannot be denied, but</hi> Agathocles <hi>had rare Qualities; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe could he have done any of theſe extraordinary Things? Hiſtorians ought then to do him Justice, in delivering with the ſame Sincerity, what was Good or Ill in him.</hi> This is the Rule which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to my ſelf in reſpect of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and ſome others. Though I think of that firſt Miniſter quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than his Flatterers; for indeed I cannot regard, without Horror, a Prelate, who ſacrifices the Liberty of <hi>France,</hi> and the Repoſe of all <hi>Europe,</hi> to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet without falling into the violent Invectives of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> and the Faction of <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with pleaſure what is Good and Valuable in that Great Politician.</p>
            <p>There is a Thing in which I would imitate <hi>Titus Livy,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and that is Brevity. The firſt employs but Ten Books in relating what paſs'd remarkable in the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth for ſeveral Ages; and the other has brought into one ſmall Volume the Reigns of <hi>Tiberius, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero.</hi> But I believe it
<pb facs="tcp:55474:16"/>is impoſſible to be ſo ſhort: The Reaſon preſents it ſelf to every Man's view. The <hi>Roman</hi> Religion did not occaſion any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; it did not cauſe Schiſms and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sects: Their Divinity had no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Political Matters. It is not ſo with Chriſtianity: There are great Diſputes in this: It has always been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into different Communions: Princes intereſt themſelves, and take a part in the Quarrels of Divines. Since the Popes have ſetled their Monarchy in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern World, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> concerns her ſelf in every thing. So that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, Controverſies of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Intereſts and Pretenſions of Popes, Biſhops, and the Clergy, the Cabals of Monks, and divers other Matters, which only regard the Church, conſiderably ſwell an Hiſtory. The good Fathers, the Jeſuits, have been at the bottom of every thing ſince the Riſe of the Society. The Relation of their endleſs Intrigues, Enterprizes and Quarrels, is Work enough to employ an Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that in the Days of the <hi>Romans</hi> Things were in another Poſture than they are at preſent. There were not ſo many Treaties with neighbouring Nations, ſo many Intrigues in the Senate, among the People, and in the Court of the Emperors. The <hi>Romans</hi> made War to extend their Territories; they had a ſmall number of Allies, whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected againſt the Powers that threatned
<pb facs="tcp:55474:16"/>them. All Intrigues terminate in gaining the People by Donatives, or promiſing to procure them a Dividend of Lands, or to obtain for them a greater Share in the Government. The time of the greateſt Intrigues in the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth doubtleſs was that of the two Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. We have not a very exact Hiſtory of this; but it is plain, all was tranſacted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſom few Perſons who had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to procure the Command of Armies in the remote Provinces. Others fell in with the prevailing Party, led by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or Avarice. That which <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> calls the <hi>Great Secret of Government,</hi> in the time of the Emperors, was to be Maſters of the Legions. He who had Intereſt or Money enough to procure them to revolt, was ſoon proclaimed Emperor. After this he had nothing more to do, but to beat out the old Poſſeſſor, or a Competitor. The Victor became lawful Sovereign, and the Vanquiſh'd was declared an Uſurper. In an Abſolute and Tyrannical Government, all things are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the Pleaſure of the Prince. The Favourite and the Miſtreſs have their Share in the Authority. When theſe are once eſtabliſhed, the Dagger, Poiſon, Falſe Informations, and Violence, are the Means they make uſe of to rid themſelves of their Enemies, and preſerve their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Thus every thing was managed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Succeſſors of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55474:17"/>
            <p>The Hiſtory of ſuch a State as I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Commonwealth and Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be very large. But the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of all Chriſtian Princes have ſo great a Relation to each other, they make ſo many Leagues and Alliances together; ſome for their own Greatneſs; others to defend themſelves from their ambitious Neighbours, that it is impoſſible to write the Hiſtory of <hi>Germany, France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> without ſpeaking at the ſame time of what paſſes in the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> If two Petty Princes have any Différence, one implores the Protection of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the other throws himſelf into the Arms of <hi>France.</hi> If the two Crowns commence a War, ſome of theſe declare for <hi>Spain,</hi> others for <hi>France,</hi> in hopes of profiting by the Conjuncture. The Powers who have the ſmalleſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt are at laſt obliged to ſide with one Party; or at leaſt to arm to keep the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance even, and prevent the Conqueror from advancing his Power too much, by the Ruins of the Vanquiſh'd. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of each Court; the Intereſts and Motions of Great Men in a State, where Arbitrary and abſolute Power is not well ſetled, cannot be ſo ſuccinctly related. Thoſe Illuſtrious Hiſtorians, who ſhall write the preſent Reign in <hi>France,</hi> will be obliged, if I gueſs aright, to enlarge more in proportion on the Affairs of the Minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. than on what has happen'd ſince the Peace of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55474:17"/>The Deſigns and Advances of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> and ſome Court Ladies, in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements and Provinces, will fill a greater Space than the Events ſince the Death of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Since <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. has obtained what <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi> had propoſed, and opened the way, to every thing is diſpoſed of by one or two Miniſters, a Miſtreſs, or a certain La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. What Character this Great Woman ought to have, Time perhaps will inform us. The Princes of the Blood, Great Lords, and Parlements, all keep the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Silence. All Wars, Alliances, and great Affairs are reſolv'd on, with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Miſtreſs, or the Lady. None can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, or obtain any Employ or Honour, but through one of theſe Channels. There are no knotty, difficult Treaties abroad: Every thing is done by the Power of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Threats. <hi>It is the King's Pleaſure it ſhould be ſo:</hi> This is the Anſwer with which his Majeſty's Miniſters often pay thoſe of Foreign Sovereigns as well as their Maſter's Subjects.</p>
            <p>Things were not ſo under the Reign of his Father. <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> impatiently endured the exceſſive Power of a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or a Miniſter. The King's Brother was not always in a Paſſive Humoun. If the firſt Prince of the Blood was weak, a younger Brother of his Houſe would not ſubmit to creep to a Cardinal. Some of the greateſt and wealthieſt Men
<pb facs="tcp:55474:18"/>of the Kingdom ſhew'd great Vigour and Courage on divers Occaſions. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd did not tamely ſuffer themſelves to be oppreſs'd without making any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The Court was forced to keep Meaſures with them, after they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Cautionary Towns. The Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> was not at that time ſo formidable abroad. But the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. began to grow ſo Potent in <hi>Germany,</hi> that it was apprehended he would entirely ſubdue it. There was a neceſſity to make Alliances with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the United Provinces, all the Proteſtant Princes, and thoſe of <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> which created Trouble enough to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The Affair of <hi>Mantua</hi> cauſed extraordinary Motions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Alps.</hi> There was a Neceſſity to aſſiſt the Duke, to preſerve a Succeſſion, which could not rightfully be conteſted. <hi>France</hi> began a Treaty and join'd with the Princes and States of <hi>Italy,</hi> alarm'd at the new Projects of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> At length the Revolutions which happen'd in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> gave occaſion to ſeveral Projects and Treaties on the part of <hi>Spain.</hi> For theſe Reaſons no one can write the Hiſtory of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. without entring into the Particulars of what happened all over <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe are the Reaſons why I have thought fit to proceed a little higher in ſome places of the firſt Part in the Affairs of Foreign Countries. <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:55474:18"/>muſt make ſo great a Figure in this Work, that it was almoſt indiſpenſable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

An Hiſtorian is like an Actor: Neither of them are accountable for the bad Parts they repreſent. The former is obliged to prefer Truth to his Intereſt and Paſſions. This is the only Divinity he ſhould adore. He muſt ever have the Judgment of Poſterity in his ſight, if he would paſs more for an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian than a Flatterer.</hi>

            <p>It is reported, <hi>Alexander</hi> deſired to revive for a little time after his Death. He would have been pleaſed to ſee what Men would then ſay of a Prince who had made ſuch a noiſe in the World. <hi>I do not wonder,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to find every one praiſe me now. Some are afraid of me; others court my Favour.</hi> If Princes judged as reaſonably as this Conqueror, to whom they ſo much love to hear themſelves compared, they would not be at the trouble to here Writers, or cauſe Triumphal Arches and Statues to be erected; nor aſſemble Men of Letters to form Deſigns for Medals to be coined to their Honour; or to compoſe Magnificent Inſcriptions to be engraven on Marble or Braſs, at the Pedeſtal of their Statues, or over a Triumphal Arch, or the Gates of a Capital or other conquered Places. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with well governing their People, and making them happy, they would leave to them the Care of immortalizing their Benefactor after his Death.

An Hiſtorian, who will not be led by Fear or Hope, Friendſhip or Hatred; who is of no Country or Party; who will call Things by their Names, without caring whether he pleaſe or give Offence; ſuch an Author, I ſay, as <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> requires, with one Stroke of his Pen, will ſhew the ridiculous Folly of your Pride, and the Baſeneſs of your Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers.</p>

               <hi>ought to love his Friends and his Country. He may ſhew his Affection to thoſe who do them good, and his Averſion to their Enemies. But when a Man has once put on the Perſon of an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, he muſt forget all that. Then you are often obliged to ſpeak Good of your Enemies, and to praiſe them when their Actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. Farther, you ought to blame your neareſt Kindred, and expoſe their Shame, if they have committed unexcuſable Faults. Take Truth from Hiſtory, and it is like an Animal which has loſt its Eyes: What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is uſeleſs. Let none then ſcruple to reprehend his Friends and praiſe his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Let him not fear, on certain Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to condemn thoſe Perſons, whoſe Merit he commonly extols. Thoſe who are at the Helm do not always ſucceed, on the contrary they do not eternally commit Faults.</hi> A good
<pb facs="tcp:55474:20"/>Author ought to judge of things without reſpect to Perſons, ſpeaking of theſe as the Subject requires. For my part, I ſo little fear being Cenſured for the Fault, <hi>Frenchmen</hi> are uſually reproached with, of being fond of their own Nation, that I do not know whether I ought not to juſtifie my ſelf here to my Countrymen, for not ſpeaking through the whole <hi>Series</hi> of this Work, very Advantageouſly of <hi>France</hi> and its Government. They would not do me Juſtice, if they thought I was fallen out with my Native Land, and this had introduced me to leave it.</p>
            <p>I am a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and I think it an Honour to be ſo; but I am not ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to my Country, as to think it far Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to any other. There is good Senſe, Merit and Virtue to be found in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If ſome Nations have more Vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Politeneſs than others, theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are not ſo conſiderable, that they ſhould ſet themſelves far above their Neighbours. Thoſe People which ſome Perſons look on as heavy, have often more good Senſe, Solidity, and Plain dealing, than others that value themſelves on their good Taſt, Sharpneſs and Wit. The one without Diſpute, is infallibly more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than the other. My Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is very dear to me, and I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in profeſſing it. But I love it as an honeſt Man ought to do. To wiſh well to a Mans Countrymen, to pray God they may want nothing which can make them
<pb facs="tcp:55474:20"/>compleatly happy in this World, or the next, is in my Opinion, to have a true and ſincere Love for a Mans Country. And I can proteſt, God be praiſed, I have ſuch a Diſpoſition of Mind. St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed, all his Auditors might become as he was, <hi>except</hi> in <hi>his Bonds.</hi> I pray in the ſame manner, for all <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> May Heaven grant they all become like me, except being almoſt under a neceſſity to leave their Native Country, to follow the Light of their Conſcience. If I am bound to <hi>France</hi> by that grateful Senſe which a Reaſonable Man ought to have for a Civil Society, where God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him Birth; this do's not hinder me from thinking my ſelf united to other Nations, by the Ties of Religion and Humanity. <hi>France</hi> may be Happy and Flouriſhing, without diſturbing its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, or unjuſtly Uſurping anothers Right. Becauſe I am of a Nation, muſt I deſire to ſee her Miſtreſs of <hi>Europe?</hi> Muſt I applaud the boundleſs Ambition of the Prince who governs her? Muſt I praiſe my Countrymen for working Fetters and Chains to bind themſelves withal? Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juſtice requires me to contribute all I can, to the Proſperity and Repoſe of my Native Land, and that I ſhould defend it when unjuſtly attacked. But I am bound by the ſame Laws of Nature, to prevent my Countrymen from deſtroying, and doing Miſchief to others. Very far from extolling their Ignominous Slavery, and
<pb facs="tcp:55474:21"/>Criminal Enterprizes, Reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion require me to Condemn, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to the utmoſt of my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>By a ſtrange Inverſion of Language and Reaſon, a Man in <hi>France</hi> is ſaid to be well affected to the Government, when he ſhews I know not what ridiculous Zeal for the Power of the King. Is the King, then the whole State? Theſe two things are very different. The State ſignifies a certain number of Men Aſſociated, and living under the ſame Laws. The King is the Perſon who has the Charge of Supporting them, and providing for the Wellfare of the People. In what do's the Happineſs of a Nation conſiſt? That ſhe is only obliged to obey Laws confirmed by a long Uſe, or made in ſuch manner, as was agreed on by the People in their firſt Confederacy, or in the Aſſemblies held after; in the Safe and Unmoleſted enjoyment of their Eſtates, and the Fruits of their Induſtry, without having theſe taken away from them by Force; in Taxes and Publick Duties being ſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Levyed, that no Man pay more than he conveniently can. To love the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or ones Country, is ardently to wiſh it all the Advantages which a Man would give his Life to procure, when they are wanting, or to preſerve them, when ſhe has the good fortune to enjoy them. In this Senſe it is pleaſant and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, for a Man to die for his Country.
<pb facs="tcp:55474:21"/>To love, as it is call'd in <hi>France,</hi> the Power and Glory of the King, is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the Eſtabliſhing Tyranny. Since the Principles and Deteſtable Policy of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> have been brought into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> a Prince thinks himſelf Glorious and Potent, if he has found a way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Abſolute Maſter of the Lives and Eſtates of his People, and ſecurely make himſelf Great, at the Expence of his Neighbours. If this be not true Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all Men in the World are deceived. What do they underſtand by the word Tyranny? The Government of thoſe, who only propoſe their own Profit.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould I Diſſemble? The love I have for my Country, gives me an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Averſion for theſe Politicks pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Mankind. I cannot value thoſe who purſue theſe Maxims, whatever good Qualities they have, or however e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent their Rank in the World be. Let ſome Perſons born to Slavery, if they pleaſe, rail at me as a <hi>Seditious Author.</hi> This is the Language now for thoſe who ſtill preſerve Love for Liberty, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where it is almoſt Extinguiſhed. I am not in any pain about it. A Learned Man Condemned the Hiſtory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mr. <hi>de Thou, becauſe it is writ,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>with a Liberty which do's not ſuit with the Age.</hi> I have not the Preſumption to compare my ſelf with that Great Man. He was infinitely above me by his Birth, and Rank; and yet more by his Sublime
<pb facs="tcp:55474:22"/>Genius and Univerſal Knowledge. The Love of Truth, is the only thing in which I think I may imitate him; I will dare to ſay, in which I ſtrive to ſurpaſs him. His Character, his Employs, his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Court, have obliged him to ſome Management, which I may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpenſe with. If his Liberty did not agree with his Time, mine will ſeem leſs proper for ours. But let the World ſpeak as it pleaſes, I will follow the Example of this Great Man, who deſpiſed Mean-ſpirited Cenſors. We are not leſs free than the Men of former times, why ſhould we not ſpeak the Truth as well as they?</p>
            <p>There is nothing remains now, but for me to give a Reaſon, why in publiſhing this Hiſtory, I have not waited till it was entirely finiſhed. A great Book frightens the World. The Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. has certain Remarkable Periods, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the King, the Removal of the Queen Mother, the Miniſtry of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> the taking of <hi>Rochell,</hi> the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War. The Reader may Repoſe himſelf at each of theſe Periods, where there is a conſiderable change of Affairs. For this Reaſon, I have divided this Work into different Parts, perhaps the Reader will not be Diſpleaſed, to have them one after the other. The Judgment which the Publick makes of the firſt, may ſet me right, and be of uſe in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones. Thoſe who will favour me with the Communication of any Memoirs,
<pb facs="tcp:55474:22"/>may adreſs them if they pleaſe to the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller. They will be thankfully received, and made uſe of with the Diſcretion they can reaſonably expect, whether they deſire to have the Honour of them, or will not be known. I ſhall only deſire they will not take it amiſs, that every thing be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, nor expect we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves to praiſe or blame, what do's deſerve neither.</p>

               <p>THE Reign, whoſe Hiſtory I am about to write,<note place="margin">The Plan of the Work.</note> abounds in Great Events.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55474:32"/>Parlements and People reduced to Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Alike averſe to his Mother, his Wife, his Brother; he treats the one ill, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the reſt to form Leagues at Home and Abroad, and at laſt to throw themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the ancient Enemies of <hi>France.</hi> The Princes of the Blood, and the Great Lords diſguſted, ſometimes at the ill Adminiſtration of a Regent, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times with the exceſſive Power of a Favourite or Miniſter, riſe under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretence of a Concern for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. The Proteſtants driven to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity by the frequent Infractions of the moſt inviolable Edict that ever was, at laſt take Arms to defend the Liberty of their Conſciences, and preſerve thoſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities which had been ſo juſtly granted them in the preceding Reign.</p>
               <p>The Enterprizes of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> on the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> force them to have recourſe to the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> and make an Alliance with her. Theſe Sovereigns, jealous of their Repoſe and Liberty, ſee, without concern, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> give up to the King of <hi>France</hi> a Place which opens a way into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> whenever he ſhall think fit to ſend any Aid thither.

                  </note>Before I enter upon the Matter, I ſhall promiſe ſome few Things of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and the End of his Life. Its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know the Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> when this latter loſt one of the greateſt Monarchs ſhe ever had. He employ'd the firſt Years of his Reign in reducing by force of Arms, or gaining by Treaties, all who had formed a potent League againſt him, under Colour of Religion, and in carrying on a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain.</hi> This Ambitious Monarch had ſupported the League with a mighty Aſſiſtance of Men and Money, out of a Deſign to place a Prince of his Houſe on the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt to diſmember that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, whoſe Power was an invincible Obſtacle to the vaſt Projects he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But finding himſelf worn out with Infirmities of Body, and ſeeing his Country quite exhauſted by the Immenſe Sums he expended, and the great number of Soldiers and Ships which he loſt in his Wars againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low Countries, England,</hi> and <hi>France. Philip,</hi> I ſay, after ſo many Men, and ſo

Henry</hi> excuſed this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of his as well as he could, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Incapacity of his Kingdom to ſupport a Foreign War, after it had been ſo miſerably haraſs'd by a Domeſtick one, which had laſted ſo many Years, and was not yet well extinguiſhed. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſpecious: But the King ſeemed impatient to give himſelf up to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and with eaſe to enjoy ſo fair a Succeſſion, which he had purchaſed with ſo much Hazard and Trouble.</p>
               <p>It muſt be own'd <hi>Henry</hi> had good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſtruſt his Strength for the future The Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> penned up in <hi>Britany,</hi> would not have made his Peace, if he had not believ'd that of <hi>Spain</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſolv'd on. Beſides, the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> who had ſerved a King bred up amongſt them, with ſo much Courage and Conſtancy, took Umbrage and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55474:34"/>His changing his Religion and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, with which he purchaſed the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Great Men, who had been Leagued againſt him, began to Alarm them; and his New Engagements to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> their crael and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had like to have cool'd them. <hi>Henry</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently confirmed his beſt Subjects by the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> which was concerted with great Induſtry and Deliberation. Happy had they been, if the Succeſſors of this good Prince, had left them peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to enjoy what he ſo juſtly granted them.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was Peace ſetled at home and abroad, but <hi>Henry</hi> ſtrove to win the Hearts of his Subjects, by publiſhing he would labour inceſſantly to make them live in Eaſe and Plenty. Several Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures were ſet up, and ſome certain Duties taken off: It is probable the great Debts he contracted, and the engagement of a great part of his Revenue, would not give him leave to take away divers others very burthenſom, and made him give ear to all Projects, for bringing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into his own Coffers. But in all this he had the Addreſs to prevent, and ſtifle all Murmurs by making the <hi>French</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſince for a long time accuſtomed to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, believe his greateſt deſire was to make them happy. The King flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſhould check the turbulent humour of divers great Men, and perhaps by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ruin them by engaging them after
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55474:35"/>his Example, to make exceſſive expences in Buildings, Play, and other more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Pleaſures. In this he found his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in a double manner. It was his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination, though he was a Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger good enough; and thoſe who could embroil the State, would be drained of Money and Credit, and forced to depend on the bounty of their Prince.</p>
               <p>This did not ſucceed in all points, as he had projected it. If the Conſtable of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi> the Mareſchals of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> did not proceed ſo far, as to take Arms to expreſs their Reſentment; ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not Rewarded according to their mind, others becauſe ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Confidents of the King, had a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhare in ſecret Councils than themſelves: Yet theſe I ords created him great Diſquiet. The juſt puniſhment of <hi>Biron,</hi> the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and violent of all the Malecontents and the Submiſſions of the Mareſchal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> Defeated the Conſpiracy which <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> had laid in his Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the III. the New King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had promiſed to ſupport. That of the Marquiſe <hi>de Vernueil,</hi> a Miſtreſs of the King, who had fooliſhly promiſed to make her his Wife, before he was married to <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> was likely to have had terrible Conſequences; but was fortunately broke by the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>d'Entragues,</hi> Father of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs; and the Impriſonment of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55474:35"/>Count <hi>d' Auvergue,</hi> her Brother by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide, and Natural Son to <hi>Charles</hi> the IX.</p>
               <p>The King complained, the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> promiſed Aid to all his Factious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. He ſhew'd his Reſentment publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he diſcovered an Intrigue of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, with a Gentleman of <hi>Provence,</hi> who undertook to deliver up the Town of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> the III.

               <p>The Declenſion of that Monarchy, was viſible to all the World. <hi>Philip</hi> the III. a Prince Inferiour to his Father for his Parts; found it in ſo ill a condition, that being unable to ſupply Arch-Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> with Proviſions neceſſary for carrying on the War againſt the <hi>

               <p>The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was ſtill weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> had no great Vices, but the Vertues which make up the chief Character of a Prince, were wanting in him.

In this they promiſed to terminate their Differences Amicably, and by Arbitration; and to joyn their Forces againſt any who ſhould Attempt to uſurp the Countries of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers.</hi> Till this ſhould be decided, it was agreed they ſhould govern Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and in common; and without prejudice to the right of the Emperor, or the other Princes pretenders.

               <p>They were both Proteſtants, and the <hi>

The pretence of Religion is never wanting upon occaſion; and here
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55474:38"/>it would have been very ſeaſonable.

This Enterprize ought to have alarmed equally all the Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> but the Jealouſie cauſed by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Religion, made the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Electours of <hi>Mentz, Triers,</hi> and ſome others, fear the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be too ſtrong, if the diſputed Countries ſhould fall to a Prince of that Religion.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55474:42"/>care he ſhould not do any thing during his ſtay there againſt the Reſpect and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience due to his Sovereign.</p>
               <p>So modeſt a Denial ſerv'd only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the King's Anger, and make him more obſtinate in his Demands of the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Conde.</hi> He ſent Orders every Day to repeat the Inſtances to the Archdukes. While he was arming powerfully in his Kingdom, the <hi>French,</hi> who were at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> took Meaſures to carry off the Princeſs, who gave ground to believe ſhe was not very averſe to it. The People ran to Arms to oppoſe this Violence. <hi>Conde</hi> at laſt reſolv'd to retire to <hi>Milan:</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> took the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into her own Palace. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes had promiſed not to give her up without the Conſent of the Prince.</p>
               <p>The Conſtable of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King, demanded his Daughter; and the neareſt Kindred of the Princeſs wrote to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> as well as he. They alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all the Family would have the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage annull'd. The King had recourſe to the Pope. He preſſed him to interpoſe his Authority, that the Princeſs being ſet at liberty, might demand a Diſſolution of it. She did not love her Husband, and the Bigotry of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who watched her narrowly, was ſo contrary to the Humour of a young Perſon accuſtomed to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> that ſhe ſeemed not very averſe to the Divorce her Kindred propoſed to her, at leaſt in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55474:42"/>But all theſe Subtilties wore fruitleſs. The Archdukes, inflexible in their Word to the Prince, anſwer'd ſtill to all the Inſtances and Menaces made them, That they would not reſtore the Princeſs without the Conſent of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who had entruſted her with them. A very generous Reſolution indeed! But is there not ground to think their ſecret Deſire to excite ſome Commotions in <hi>France,</hi> to traverſe the vaſt Projects of <hi>Henry,</hi> inſpired them at leaſt as much as their love to Equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55474:47"/>the day after his Fathers Death, and the Regency of the Widow was confirmed there in a Solemn manner; this did not a little conduce to ſettle the Tranquility of the Remote Provinces.</p>

After every one had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their place, <hi>Mary</hi> began a ſmall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which ſhe had premeditated. Scarce had ſhe uttered two or three Words, but a ſhower of Tears hindred her from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding farther. It was doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they proceeded from Grief or Joy. Every one made what conſtruction he pleaſed. Reſuming her Diſcourſe after a ſew Sighs,<note place="margin">Mercure Francois. 1610.</note> either Affected or Sincere, <hi>I have brought you here my Son,</hi> ſays the Queen, <hi>to intreat you to take that care of him, which you are obliged to do. I conjure you to do this by the Memory of his Father, by the Love you ought to have for your ſelves, and your Zeal for your Country. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him to follow your Advice, in all the concerns of State. It is your part to ſee this be wholſom and good.</hi> When ſhe had done, ſhe came down within the Bar, as if ſhe would ſtill give them a liberty to agree in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55474:47"/>their Opinions concerning the Regency. The Princes, Lords, and Magiſtrates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced there was more Ceremony than Reality in this, begg'd her to take her place again. <hi>Mary</hi> skill'd in the Art of Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſuffer'd her ſelf to be preſt for a long time, till the Inſtances ſhe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſeem'd to be a force on her Modeſty and Grief.</p>
               <p>Young <hi>Lewis</hi> rehearſed well enough the Diſcourſe prepared for him. It was not omitted, here to inſert the <hi>young King would follow the Advice of his Parliament.</hi> This is a Language which ancient Cuſtom has made uſual in the beginning of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, but is never remembred by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when their Authority is once Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and her Son, ſaid the ſame thing. Nevertheleſs we have ſeen with our own Eyes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Reign, and we ſhall ſee in that whoſe Hiſtory I now write, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, and his Succeſſor, have too much given ear to vile Flatterers, who have prompted them to annul the Authority of a Body of Men, <hi>on which the Preſervation of</hi> France <hi>does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,</hi>

And this Diſcourſe is Seditious, under the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.</p>
               <p>The Chancellour aſſured them, the late King had more than once ſignified his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, according to divers preceding Examples; that the Queen his Wife ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55474:48"/>have the Adminiſtration of Affairs, in caſe he died before his Son was a Major. After the Chancellor's Harangue was over, the firſt Preſident began. He exhorted the young Prince to ſtrive to deſerve the Title of <hi>Father of his People,</hi> as the good King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. had done, on whoſe Throne he ſat, and to follow the Inſtructions which St. <hi>Lewis</hi> left to Poſterity. <hi>Servin,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate-General, did the ſame; and all was concluded by the King's Decree, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his Seat of Juſtice, and confirming that made the preceding Day, and by ſending it to other Parliaments, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it throughout the Kingdom. The Speeches of theſe Two great Magiſtrates would have been worthy of their Gravity and Reputation, if they had given leſs exceſſive Praiſes to a Princeſs, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſerved the moſt moderate ones.</p>
               <p>The New Decree being given out, the King returned with mighty Shouts and Acclamations of the Multitude, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire whatever ſtrikes their Senſes. All Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wiſhed a long Proſperity to the Son of the Great <hi>Henry,</hi> crying for Juſtice on the Authours of his Father's Death. Happy had it been, if the Prayers and Wiſhes of his Subjects could have obtained for him the Qualities of Mind and Inclinations neceſſary to tread in the Steps of the good Kings who preceded him; the number of whom is very ſmall. But he had not Genius enough to acquire the one, and his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55474:48"/>Mother would not permit him to have a Governour to form him for the other.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> was extremely ſurprized to find all done in his Abſence. He made haſte to <hi>Paris,</hi>

               <p>The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> ſought his Friendſhip with great earneſtneſs.

This Match could not be concluded without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Uncle. <hi>Soiſſons</hi> hated <hi>Sully</hi> mortally. He flatter'd himſelf that <hi>Eper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> exaſperated againſt that Miniſter, who had done very ill Offices to the One, and the Other, with the late King, would join with him to rid themſelves of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, The Duke did not refuſe the Friendſhip of a Prince of the Blood, but would not engage to ſerve him in all his Projects The Edge of the Count was not taken off by this: He propoſes to his new Friend, to ſtab the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> in the <hi>Louvre.</hi> A baſe and cowardly Action un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, I will not ſay of a Prince, but of the meaneſt Man in the World! It ſtruck with Horror, one who valu'd himſelf on his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Probity. <hi>Epernon</hi> reply'd as civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he could, his Truſt would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to ſuffer a Violence of that kind in the King's Houſe. The Count took this Denyal ill. However the ſecret Deſire he had to raiſe himſelf above the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who fill'd a Place that <hi>Soiſſons</hi> thought belonged of Right to him, made
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55474:49"/>him diſſemble his ill Humour. Could <hi>Epernon</hi> after this maintain a Friendſhip with a Man who had diſcover'd ſo vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous a Heart? However great a Prince is by his Birth or Intereſt, he can deſerve nothing but Hatred and Contempt, when he once becomes guilty of ſo black a Crime.</p>
               <p>Jealouſies broke out, and Intrigues grew numerous,<note place="margin">State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the beginning of the Regency.</note> when the Debates began about forming the Regents Council. The Princes of the Blood juſtly pretended to have a place there by Right of their Birth. The Conſtable of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> thought they ought not to be excluded. Thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> aſſured of the good Intentions of the Queen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, hoped to raiſe themſelves. They were too weak now to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the future with obtaining the Superiority they formerly had over the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> yet they did not deſpair at leaſt to rival the Princes of the Blood. But they found at home a great Obſtacle to their coming into the Council: Two Lords of the ſame Houſe could not be called to it. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was the eldeſt; but the Age and Experience of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> his Uncle, requir'd him to be preferr'd. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> being dangerouſly ill ſome Years before, had a mind to form a Council. He na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this Lord then, who was heartily reconciled to him, and ſince that time had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55474:50"/>given the King Marks of his inviolable Fidelity. This was a great Prejudice in his Favour. The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> too demanded to be admitted, and diſputed the Precedence with the <hi>Guiſes.</hi> New Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities on all ſides!</p>
               <p>The Emulation between the Marechal of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Epernon</hi> was grown to ſo great a height, that it was not poſſible the one ſhould be in the Council to the Prejudice of the other. This latter was conſiderable for his Charge of Colonel General of the Foot, and other great Places. The Queen did not dare to give diſtaſte to a haughty and powerful Man, who had juſt ſerved her in a very Handſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Bouillon</hi> had a great Heart, a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and diſcerning Mind, kept a ſtrict Alliance and conſtant Intelligence with Foreign Princes. The Sovereignty of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> made him conſiderable at home and abroad. No one had more Intereſt than he with the Proteſtants of <hi>France.</hi> The late King ſtood in fear of him. He gave a Check to his turbulent and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humour, but would not puſh the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to an Extremity. So that the Marechal was capable of doing a great deal of good, if he followed his Reaſon, or a great deal of Miſchief, if he abandoned himſelf to his Paſſion. There were other Lords of great Bitth, who might pretend to have a place in the Council, but they were yet of an Age, in which Men of Quality have ſtronger Inclinations to Pleaſure, than to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55474:50"/>concern themſelves in Matters of State. Of this number were the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> both Natural Sons of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and the Count of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother of the ſame Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor <hi>de Sillery,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sully, Villeroy,</hi> and the Preſident <hi>Jeannin,</hi> ſaw all this Emulation with Pleaſure. This left the entire Direction of Affairs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, under the Name of the Queen. Therefore in the firſt place they adviſed her, not to give Diſtaſte to any Perſon till the firſt Prince of the Blood ſhould return, and to admit into her Council all the great Lords who demanded a Place there. The greater the number of theſe was, the leſs Intereſt and Power any particular Perſons could have. In the mean time, each took his Opportunity to entertain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. They took care to prepare Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be propoſed, to give ſeemingly ſome Employment to the Aſſembly. But theſe Gentlemen foreſaw it would ſoon degenerate into Confuſion: That ſome would take a diſtaſte themſelves, and others might be removed under colour of ſending them to execute their Places and Governments.</p>

But it had been more to the purpoſe, to perſwade effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe good Fathers to pardon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, the injury which they thought they had received.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55474:53"/>ſay nothing, for fear of any Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in an Affair that muſt be ſo nicely handled. Every one wonder'd that a Man who knew the World ſo well, and wanted not Prudence, ſhould not take ſo good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He publiſhed a long Letter addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Queen, to perſwade the World, <hi>Mariana</hi> was a private Perſon diſown'd by their Body, who had true Notions of the Authority of Princes, and the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due to them. The thing happened at the Friends of the Jeſuits had foretold. A thouſand Pamphlets were inſtantly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt the Fathers Letter. It is full, ſay they, of Ambiguous Expreſſions and Tricking. They inſulted him on his pretended diſclaiming the Doctrine, which was plainly forced to comply with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity. <hi>It comes too late,</hi> ſaid ſome, maliciouſly enough <hi>to the</hi> good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>but perhaps it will not be uſeleſs to the Children of him, who is now in his Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the defence of <hi>Coton</hi> was weak, and ill put together. What he ſaid of the Complaints of the Provincial Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held at <hi>Paris</hi> ſome years before, and the Anſwer of their General <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> gave an Advantage to the Enemies of the Society. The <hi>French</hi> Jeſuits ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſired their Superiour to ſtop the Liceace, and Suppreſs the Books of ſome Authours, who had written ſome things to the prejudice of <hi>France,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave them this Anſwer. <hi>We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Judgment and Care of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55474:53"/>And we are very ſorry, that this was not diſcover'd till after the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Books. We have taken order they ſhall be corrected, and we will have a care that nothing of the like nature ſhall happen for the future.</hi> This is very cold and ambiguous, for an Opinion which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Attempts on the Lives of Soveraigns.

The Heart was ſent to the College of Jeſuits, which the King had founded at <hi>la Fleche</hi> in <hi>Anjou.</hi> He had ordered it thus before his Death. <hi>Coton</hi> made his Funeral Oration there.

               <p>What can a good Chriſtian ſay in praiſe of a Prince, dead in ſeveral Criminal Habits, on the point of putting all <hi>Europe</hi> in a Flame, and cauſing a great Effuſion of Blood, to ſatisfie his Ambition, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf of his Enemies, who were not in a condition to hurt him, to force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Princeſs in the face of the World,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55474:54"/>whoſe Husband took Refuge, to defend himſelf from the Solicitations and Purſuits of a King, whom love had deprived of all Senſeand Reaſon? His pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was a fair Field for prophane Orators, void of Religion to exerciſe their Eloquence. Their Triumph in ſo Important a Conqueſt, ſerved to cover his ill Life, and impenitent Death. But were they ever aſſured <hi>Henry</hi> was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely a Catholick. Let us leave that to the judgment of God. If it be true, this Princes Conſcience was ſetled in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, it is certain his irregular Life, did not do much honour to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which Politicks probably induced him to embrace. The flattering Biſhops who praiſed him after his Death, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Courage to reprove him for his Debauches, as the Proteſtant Miniſters had done before he left them.</p>

                  </note> wiſe Men ſpoke very differently of the Qualities and Actions of the Deceaſed King. Some admired his Happineſs in coming to the Crown from ſo remote a Degree, that it was doubted if the Right of Succeſſion could extend ſo far. Others praiſed his Valour in War, his undaunted Courage in the moſt dangerous Occaſions, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Ability in the command of Armies; his Moderation in his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, his Conſtancy in Adverſity, his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to his greateſt Enemies, his Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, his Love to his Subjects, his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not to drive them to Extremity, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55474:55"/>to leave them to return to their Duty when they went beyond Murmurs; and laſtly, the Mildneſs with which he heard their Remonſtrances.</p>
               <p>Other more diſcerning Perſons, ſaid there was more Raſhneſs than Prudence in the Bravery of <hi>Henry.</hi> That he expoſed himſelf to Dangers without Neceſſity, That if he had met with an Enemy more active and able, than the Duke of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne,</hi> he would have been forced to fly into <hi>England</hi> a little after the Death of his Predeceſſour. That the Heads of the League were better rewarded, than his moſt faithful Adherents; that inſtead of being Liberal, he was Prodigal to Perſons that deſerved nothing. That he gave with Profuſion to his Miſtreſſes, and thoſe who ſerved him in his Pleaſures. That he had an exorbitant Paſſion for Play: That he diſcover'd a covetous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, very little agreeable with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a great Prince: That under the colour of eaſing the People, he laid on New Taxes. That he introduced into the State, Selling of Offices.</p>
               <p>The Ill natured People did not ſpare to reflect on his Domeſtick Conduct. They cenſur'd him ſharply for his manner of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Queen <hi>Marguerite,</hi> to follow the Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of her Temper. <hi>More inſenſible than the Emperour</hi> Claudius, ſaid they, <hi>he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this new</hi> Meſſalina, <hi>whom he owned for his lawful Wife, to diſhonour him publickly. Did he intend at his own Expence, to teach
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55474:55"/>thoſe whoſe Wives he Debauched, to be eaſie Husbands.</hi> All Men ſpoke with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his advances towards marrying <hi>Gabriéle d'Etrees,</hi> and his Ingratitude to <hi>Harlay de Sancy,</hi> whom he turned out of his Places, for delivering his Thoughts freely on ſo ſcandalous a Match.

                  </note>Sometime before the Body of <hi>Henry</hi> was in his Tomb, there was a debate in private concerning the Armies which the late King had Raiſed, which were very chargeable to keep up.

                  <hi>A Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Crafty Enemy, will find ways to embroil the State. His Catholick Majeſty propoſed to the late King, the double Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the</hi> Infanta <hi>with</hi> Monſ. <hi>the</hi> Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, <hi>and of the Prince of</hi> Spain, <hi>with</hi> Madame <hi>the Eldeſt Daughter of</hi> France. <hi>We ought to Disband the Troops which give
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55474:56"/>Jealouſie to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and reſume the Negotiation of the two Marriages, to make a firm Alliance.</hi> This <hi>Mary</hi> moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſired, being Prepoſſeſſed by her <hi>Italian</hi> Confidents, who were corrupted by the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> the new Regent imagined the Eſtabliſhment of her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, depended upon her good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with the Pope, and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This latter indeed had made diverſe ſteps before the Death of <hi>Henry,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this double Alliance, and <hi>Paul</hi> V. labour'd to effect it. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hoped to find her Advantage in it. Being convinced it was not poſſible to ruin the Proteſtants without the Concurrence of the two Crowns, ſhe labour'd with all her Might, to form an Alliance between thoſe Rival Powers. Whilſt the one was buſie to overthrow the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> they Projected to engage the other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> For the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the two <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Crowns, they were not in any great pain about them. The firſt did not ſeem difficult to win. <hi>Sweden</hi> was imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who attempted to recover the Dominions, of which he thought himſelf unjuſtly deprived.

               <p>This was the Project of the Courts of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Madrid;</hi> but <hi>Henry</hi> too well underſtood his own Intereſt, and that of the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> to fall into the ſnare laid for him. Very far from giving ear to the double Marriage propoſed to him, he promiſed his Eldeſt Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Plemont,</hi> and ſent <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> into <hi>Lorrain</hi> to treat with the Duke, who had no Male Children for the Marriage of his Eldeſt Daughter, with the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> No ſooner was <hi>Henry</hi> dead, but the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> reſumed the Treaty of Alliance between the two Crowns by a double Marriage. The Regent had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſired it, and the private Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Spain</hi> ſupported it with all their Intereſt, in the Council of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The Suſpicion which the <hi>Goſpellers</hi> had of the Catholick Party, was the cauſe of more Commotions; <hi>Rodolphus</hi> appeaſed theſe without much Difficulty, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a Proclamation.

The <hi>Goſpellers</hi> had a ſolemn Thankſgiving, upon the publiſhing this Proclamation; but their Enemies every day finding new Pretences to hinder the Concluſion of the matter, the <hi>Goſpellers</hi> began to raiſe Soldiers, and brought them into <hi>Prague.</hi>

It was pretty commonly believed, Perſons of Eminent Quality had a ſhare in this Myſtery of Iniquity, and it was not judg'd convenient to diſcloſe it. Some pretended this was only done to ſpare the Reputation of certain Perſons of the firſt Rank, who had made this uſe of <hi>la d'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couman,</hi> to ruine their Enemies. <hi>So ill and revengeful a Woman as</hi> la Vernueil, ſaid they, <hi>may well enough be guilty of a great Crime.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55474:85"/>would ſpare her.</hi> Could ſhe ever find a fairer opportunity <hi>to revenge the frequent Diſquiets, which the ill Nature and Raillery of a Rival had given her.

He had had a good Opinion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and it is thought would have embraced it, if he had not met with Obſtacles from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the I. and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Emperor his Father preſſed by the Pope, threatned <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> to Diſinherit him; but if the Son had ſhewn greater Reſolution, the Father would have found it no eaſie Matter to have made ſuch an Excluſion valid.

               <p>The poor Duke ſpoil'd all his Affairs, by aiming too much to be crafty. His Intrigue with <hi>England</hi> did not ſucceed better than any of the reſt. The Regent determined too on the double Marriage between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> thought no

                  </note>The Queen was the more Solicitous, to put a ſtop to the Commotions in <hi>Savoy,</hi> becauſe the Court feared the Proteſtants met at <hi>Saumur,</hi> might take Umbrage at it. When the Reformed of <hi>France</hi> ſaw there was a neceſſity for them to defend themſelves againſt thoſe who attacked them with open force, they began to form ſet Meetings in different Provinces of the Kingdom, to agree on Meaſures for their Safety, and the free Exerciſe of their Religion. One or more Provinces joined together, firſt held their Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſembly. Out of theſe, they deputed a certain number of Gentlemen, of thoſe they called Elders or Miniſters, to form the General Aſſembly, who were to take
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55474:103"/>Reſolutions for the common Good of the whole Body. Reaſon and Natural Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty allow of theſe ſort of Confederacies. The Primitive Chriſtians united, and had their Meetings for the Regulation of their Diſcipline, and preſerving the Purity of the Goſpel. After their Example, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed had their Synods to draw up their Confeſſion of Faith, and form the Government of their Churches. Theſe being born in a Chriſtian State, where Subjects have Privileges and Liberties, had not only their Religion to take care of, but were under an Indiſpenſable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to defend their Right, as far as the Rules of Natural Equity and Chriſtianity admit againſt their King, and a Faction of their Countrymen, who ſtrove to oppreſs them.</p>
               <p>The Sovereign Power ought to hinder as far as may be, all Aſſociations and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which may cauſe Diſorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in a State; but this muſt be by a due Execution of the Fundamental Laws, and maintaining thoſe Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which Subjects cannot without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice be deprived of. It is reaſonable to alledge, Men ought not to form a State within a State. None would think of this, if they were left peaceably to enjoy their Birthright. But for Princes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prevent Diſorders which would never happen, if they were diſpoſed to do Juſtice; and to uſe theſe plauſible Maxims, to oppreſs with more eaſe thoſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55474:103"/>whom they have Sworn to protect, is a Tyranny which it is lawful to oppoſe. This is ever moſt dangerous, when it is covered with the fair Colours of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> liked theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples very well, and thought them ſolid and conducing to the Welfare and Repoſe of Civil Society, whilſt he was ſtruggling to defend himſelf againſt the power of the League; but when he once ſaw himſelf Maſter of a fair Kingdom, he ſoon aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd thoſe Sentiments, which Intereſt more than Reaſon had led him to embrace. Princes never conſult this Oracle; they are only entertained with Diſcourſes of Reaſon, when they are not in a condition capable of underſtanding it. In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of their Lives they are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and Tranſported with Paſſion for their own Greatneſs. Whatever makes them abſolute and Independent, ever ſeems moſt Juſt and Reaſonable to them. After the Verification of the Edict of <hi>Nants, Henry</hi> did not without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, grant the Proteſtants leave to hold a General Meeting. He was afraid the Lords that reſorted to it, or had their Creatures there, ſhould attempt any thing to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are not the Synods,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine Matters of Diſcipline and Religion? As for Civil Affairs, and the keeping the Edict of Pacification, the two Deputies General which I allow the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55474:104"/>to have in my Court, can repreſent to me the Griefs and Complaints of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. I will take care to do them Juſtice.</hi> This manner of Reaſoning had been good, if <hi>Henry</hi> had had the Knowledge and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity not to be Surprized by the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and other crafty Men, who were ever near him, to Extort ſomething to the Diſadvantage of the Reformed. The continual Induſtry of their Enemies to do them Miſchief, made theſe Meetings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Indiſpenſably neceſſary. The King having come to an Agreement with the Proteſtants, that they ſhould Nominate ſix capable Perſons for their Agents, and that out of this Number, he ſhould chuſe two which he liked beſt, it was neceſſary they ſhould meet for the Nomination of theſe Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> indeed declared, his Intention was, theſe Aſſemblies ſhould only concern themſelves in the Choice of fit Perſons, to be their Deputies General. But thoſe who reſigned this Employ, being to give an Account of what they had Tranſacted, it was not poſſible for this Aſſembly to avoid entring upon the Diſcuſſion of ſome Political Matters. <hi>Henry</hi> ſaw this very clearly. The good King contented with, taking Precaution againſt the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and ſome other Proteſtant Lords whom he was jealous of, granted a Permiſſion to the Reformed, to meet and Adreſs their Complaints and Deſires to him. The Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> his Faithful
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55474:104"/>Miniſter, was a great Aſſiſtance to him on theſe Occaſions. He ſtrove to manage all things ſo, as to give the King Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the moſt moderate Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants might have no reaſon to complain, <hi>Sully</hi>'s Station was enough to Embaraſs any Man. To ſerve his Maſter, and content the Reformed, was no eaſie Matter. Turbulent Reſtleſs Spirits were continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exclaiming, and the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> all whoſe Motions he obſerved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Implacable Hatred againſt him.</p>

                  <hi>Boiſſiſe</hi> and <hi>Bullion</hi> Counſellors of State, and Commiſſioners ſent by the King to the Aſſembly at <hi>Saumur,</hi> having brought with them hopes of the Favour of the Court, there was a ſerious deſign to draw up the Complaints and Requeſts of the Reformed Party. Whilſt this was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by Perſons appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there aroſe a Debate about the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi>'s Concerns. He feared the Conſequences of the Threats, made him to appoint Commiſſioners to enquire into his paſt Actions, and proceed againſt him, if he perſiſted to refuſe to lay down his place of Great Maſter of the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his Government of <hi>Poitou.</hi> To bring him to do this with the better Grace, the Court offered him the choice of two ſorts of Recompences, a Dignity as that of Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> or a conſiderable Sum of Money. The Duke deſired to keep his Places and Government, and convey both to the Marqueſs of <hi>Rony</hi> his Son. He could find no way beſides to baffle the Potent Enemies he had at Court, but by engaging all the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party to ſupport him and declare loudly their cauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55474:108"/>was concerned in his Preſervation. He took Meaſures to ſucceed in this Project, and the Mareſchal was no leſs buſie in Traverſing it; reckoning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Poitou</hi> his own, by Virtue of the Regents Promiſe, when <hi>Sully</hi> ſhould be deprived of it.</p>

                  <hi>Sully</hi> made a Remonſtrance to the Meeting. Under Colour of deſiring their Advice, he dextrouſly inſinuated, that his Religion was the only cauſe of Diſgrace, and the Aſſociation Oath which he had juſt now taken, would expoſe him ſtill farther to the Diſpleaſure of the Court. This was at leaſt true in part;<note place="margin">Mercure Francois 1611.</note> the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were convinced it was ſo, and the moſt Diſintereſted amongſt them, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Sully.</hi> The Conſideration all Men had for the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> a Lord alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very Eminent for his great Courage, his rare Probity,<note place="margin">A Diſcourſe between the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duke of <hi>Sully's</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</note> his Diſcernment, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſtill encreaſed the Friends of <hi>Sully,</hi> whoſe Daughter he had Married. This was an Invincible Obſtacle to <hi>Bouillon's</hi> deſigns and embaraſſed him exceedingly. He thought to ſurmount, this, by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Rohan</hi> to abandon his Father-in-Law, pretending his Cauſe was deſperate.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55474:108"/>into. A Superintendent of the Finances, and a Great Maſter of the Artillery, are not only anſwerable for what they do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for the Management of their Commiſſioners and Inferior Officers. If the Court ſhould appoint Commiſſioners to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Duke of</hi> Sully's <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do you think they would not find ſome plauſible Pretence, to take away his Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Aſſembly and the Reformed, will have no colour of Complaint, nay, though wrong be done to the Duke of</hi> Sully. <hi>The Matter will be Determined in the uſual Forms of Law. For you,</hi> My Lord, <hi>you make ſuch a Profeſſion of exact Probity. You are ſo great a Lover of good Order, in a Word, you have ſo Loyal a</hi> French <hi>Heart, you will not be able to ſtir, when the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be determined Judicially.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> took this Complement very ill? <hi>What,</hi> replyed he with ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, <hi>after the Great Services the Duke of</hi> Sully <hi>has done to the late King, ſhall he become a Prey to thoſe who were always doing Miſchief to the State. His Conduct is unblamable, and we do not fear it ſhould be examined. He is a Peer, and cannot be judged but by a Court of Peers. If his Enemies endeavour to bring him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other Tribunal, his Kinſmen and Friends will never endure ſuch an Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Be aſſured,</hi> My Lord, <hi>that I will do my Duty on this Occaſion, and will not leave my Father-in-Law to be trampled on.</hi>

                  </note> The Aſſembly declared for <hi>Sully.</hi> They preſſed him to keep his Places, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of Great Maſter of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery. But if he was inclined to accept of a Reward, they intreated him rather to accept of a Dignity, than a Sum of Money. The one ſuited better with the Duke of <hi>Sully's</hi> Family, and the other with the good of the Reformed Churches. In the Concluſion, the Aſſembly declared <hi>Sully</hi>'s particular Intereſt, and that of the whole Proteſtant Party were Inſeparable on this Occaſion; and that they would aſſiſt him if any ſhould Attempt to give him Trouble for his Adminiſtration, by any unlawful Methods. This Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was attacked in ſeveral Libels. One came out with the Title of the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of <hi>Charenton.</hi> This was a Satyr on the Rough and Covetous Humour of the Duke. The Author Admoniſhes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that this ſtep of theirs in ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus highly a private Perſon, was ſubject to the moſt Siniſter Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they would do well to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and reſerved.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to break up the Meeting at <hi>Saumur,</hi> with all ſpeed.</note>The Court Reſented it, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſhould uſe ſuch high Language in their Aſſembly. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> made a Speech full of Vigour, Courage, and Piety. He was heard with Pleaſure, and every Man diſcovered more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy than before. That which <hi>Rohan</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:55474:109"/>then delivered as a Maxim of State, is ſince become a Prophecy,<note place="margin">V. le Diſcours du Duc de Rohan a Saumur apres ſes Memoires in 4.</note> and we ſee the Accompliſhing of it in our Times. <hi>Rules of State,</hi> ſays that Lord, <hi>change with the Times. No certain Maxims can be laid down. That which is profitable to one King, is prejudicial to another: If when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King of</hi> France <hi>becomes a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of our Religion, he loſes the Protection of it all over</hi> Chriſtendom: <hi>He enriches ſome Neighbour with that Title: He does not encreaſe his Interest in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>he entirely ruins his Kingdom.</hi> The Regents Council being devoted to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> was very far from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Counſels ſo ſafe and conducing to the Wellfare of <hi>France.</hi> The Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Union, and good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> ſcared the Court. This was enough to break the Double Marriage, which the Queen Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It was reſolved therefore to divide the Party, and break up the Aſſembly, and to do this in ſuch a manner, that they ſhould have no reaſon to complain of any but themſelves.</p>
               <p>After ſome time treating with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the King about the Paper, <hi>Boiſſiſe</hi> and <hi>Bullion</hi> declared, they had no Orders to give an Anſwer, and it was requiſite for the Aſſembly to depute ſome Perſons to the Court, to carry their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Requeſts. This is done. The Deputies are well received by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. They are amuſed with fair words;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55474:110"/>But how were they ſurprized, when in ſtead of giving them the Paper with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Anſwer,<note place="margin">V. la Relation de l'aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blee de Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur apres les Memoires de Rohan in 40.</note> as they were made to hope, the Chancellor declared, this ſhould not be done before the Nomination of ſix Perſons, two of which the King would chuſe for Deputies General of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. This was in plain <hi>French,</hi> to tell them the Court would not give them any Anſwer to the Paper they preſented, till after the Diſſolution of their Meeting. This could not hold longer than till the Nomination was made, the King having only allowed of it for this purpoſe. It was in vain to inſiſt, and make very humble Remonſtrances. <hi>The King never treats with his Subjects,</hi> repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſters, <hi>He grants what Favours he thinks fit.

                  <hi>The Queſtion is only about a Formality,</hi> ſaid ſome Mercenary Slaves of the Court. <hi>The King will not deliver to us the favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwers which he intends to give us. This is but decent, to ſhew it is his favour which he voluntarily grants, and not Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles extorted by a long Treaty. It concerns us to obtain what we deſire, but in what manner this is indifferent.</hi> Thoſe who had moſt Knowlege and Integrity, were not dazled with this. They ſaw that if the Aſſembly were once broke up, they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55474:110"/>muſt be content with what Terms the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent would pleaſe, and the Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the two Deputy Generals, would be too weak to oblige the Court to take notice of them. But the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had gained a very conſiderable Party. <hi>La Varenne, Valet de Chambre</hi> of the King ſent by the Court, a Man of great Addreſs and Management, went from Door to Door to diſtribute, or promiſe Gratifications to thoſe who would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them.</p>
               <p>When the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouillon</hi> thought the Party well enough united, he drew up himſelf the form of a Letter, which the Regent ſhould write to the Meeting, and ſent it privately to Court. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this, was to require the Aſſembly to proceed inceſſantly to the Nomination of ſix Perſons, to receive the Anſwers given to their Paper, and then to break up. Thoſe who refuſed to obey this Order, were declared Rebels; and the leſſer Number which were won over by the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> was Authoriſed to Name ſix Perſons to the King. The Regent ſent the Letter as <hi>Bouillon</hi> had contrived: This was Communicated in the firſt place to divers Perſons, to ſound their Inclinations. Moſt were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhould withdraw, and not hear it read. But <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornay,</hi> and the Wiſeſt part, thought the Party made by the Mareſchal and the Court, ſhould pay a blind Obedience, and the reſt refuſe to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55474:111"/>do it; that ſuch a Separation would cauſe a fatal Diviſion in the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. For this reaſon, they ſtrove to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the moſt Warm and Zealous to uſe Prudence and Management on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

                  <hi>We know well enough the Author of this Pernicious Advice,</hi> ſaid the Wiſe <hi>Du Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.

The more the Reformed are united amongſt themſelves, the more they will be in a condition to ſerve their Prince uſefully.</hi> Three or four of the Court Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, would have ſtood up at the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Commiſſary, and have made a noiſe, but the Prudence of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and the Remonſtrances of the reſt ſtopt them.</p>

               <p>This was the end of one of the moſt Famous Proteſtant Meetings, after three Months Sitting. It was compoſed of the moſt Eminent Men for their Birth, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Experience in Buſineſs. They would have been more Succeſsful in their Labours, for the benefit of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if they had not furniſhed the Court with means to make an Advantage of Diviſions, by the Ambition and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of ſome particular Members. This Aſſembly had given the Regent ſome Diſquiet, and alarmed divers Towns, who imagined the Reformed would now be more potent than ever. When it was found they were broke up without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55474:112"/>any advantage, their Enemies inſulted them on all ſides, and divers Libels againſt them were publiſhed.

Theſe Men ſaid they, only ſeek to <hi>Embroil</hi> the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>kindle a Civil War.</hi> As for the <hi>Zealous,</hi> they painted theſe as People whoſe love to their Religion, made them Suſpicious and Diffident. <hi>Their ignorant Zeal,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>their Prepoſſeſſion, that all endeavours are uſed to diſtreſs them, made theſe comply with the former. In the laſt place, the Judicious</hi> were the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and thoſe of his Party. Their Obedience and Moderation was praiſed.

The Title of it was, <hi>The Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> or, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Papacy.</hi> The Deſign of the Author was to ſhew againſt the Cardinals <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by what degrees the Monarchy of the Pope was formed, and the ſeveral Oppoſitions which Honeſt Men made, to the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a Power ſo contrary to the Spirit
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55474:113"/>of the Goſpel. There was nothing very extraordinary in this, the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> were accuſtomed to this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. It had been handled in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Books; the Cut in the Front of this Book, gave greater Offence to them, than all the reſt. <hi>Paul</hi> the V. was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in it, with the Flattering and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Inſcriptions made for him on the other ſide of the Mountains. Some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons applied to him, what the Holy Ghoſt ſays of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, gave him the Title of the moſt Invincible Monarch of the Chriſtian Common-wealth, the moſt Ardent Defender of the Papal Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; in ſhort, <hi>Vice God.</hi> This was a word newly invented to his Honour. Since Men who make a Profeſſion of the Goſpel, have puſhed Flattery to ſuch an Extravagance, can we admire that Pagans ſhould place their Princes in the number of the Gods, whom they adored?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> made him ridiculous by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and lucky Remark. By adding the value of the Numeral Letters of the Latin words, which ſignifie <hi>Paul</hi> V. <hi>Vice God,</hi> he found the number 666. which makes the Myſterious number of the Beaſt ſpoke of in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelation.</hi> The Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed applauded this Diſcovery, and their People being now perſwaded that <hi>Paul</hi> V. was truly the Son of <hi>Perdition,</hi> whom the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> would deſtroy, <hi>by the Breath of his Mouth,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of his Coming,</hi> they flattered themſelves they ſhould

He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelf without much difficulty on this Croſs, and ſhew'd, he contemned the Threats, which his Enemies exaſperated againſt him, made him on all ſides.</p>
               <p>The more enlightn'd Perſons in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did only laugh at the Fancy of the Author. This Sportive Wit ſeemed very ſeaſonable to them, to put to Confuſion a Prieſt who being come to be Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was pleaſed to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf flatter'd in ſuch an Impious manner. But the Monks and Bigots made a great Noiſe. The Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> was in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Heat, and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſent Briefs to complain of the Outrage done him. The Regent was not leſs alarmed than the reſt. She could not endure to hear it ſaid, the <hi>Pope was Antichriſt.</hi> Beſides the Reaſons common to all of her Religion, to oppoſe a Dogm which make them paſs <hi>for Worſhippers of the Beaſt, Mary de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi> had a particular one. The Validity of her Marriage with <hi>Henry,</hi> was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Authority of the Pope, who declared his former with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> null, and the Regent imagined all who looked on the Pope as Antichriſt,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55474:114"/>could not look upon her as the lawful Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. This made her deſire to ſee <hi>de Mornay's</hi> Book blaſted, at leaſt in appearance.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55474:115"/>it cannot be denyed that the Pope is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt in this Senſe, and that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is Antechriſtian. If it be true, as it ſeems to be, that to riſe and oppoſe what is called God, or what Men adore, be to put a Mans ſelf above thoſe to whom the Lord of all things has ſaid; <hi>Ye are Gods, and the Sons of the moſt High,</hi> and to aſſume Honours which are due to him alone, is it not evident then that the Pope is, or at leaſt reſembles very much the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> and the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> foretold by St. <hi>Paul?</hi> As for the Prophecies of St. <hi>John</hi> the Proteſtants, are not the firſt who have applied them to the Pope. There is no need of ſeeking ways round about, to find Characters very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe we ſee in him. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the Pagans and Chriſtians in theſe latter times, ſeems ſo juſt, that it is difficult to determine which of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters are in the Right, who Explain the Prophecies of the Revelations, of one and the other <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One <hi>Ferrier</hi> thought to diſtinguiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the beginning of this Age, by maintaining a publick Theſis at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where he was Profeſſor of Divinity, that <hi>the Pope is Antichriſt.</hi> The Parlement of <hi>Toulouſe</hi> proceeded againſt him, but he declined their Juriſdiction, and removed the Affair to the Chamber of the Edict at <hi>Caſtres.</hi> Some little time after, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants made a New Article of Faith in their National Synod of <hi>Gap</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:55474:115"/>in which they declared, that they believed and would maintain; <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>is properly</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>and</hi> the Son Perdition <hi>foretold in the Word of God.</hi> This New Article was to be the XXXI of the Confeſſion of Faith of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France. Henry</hi> IV. took it ill, than in his Reign they ſhould deviſe a thing they had never once thought of, when the Diſputes were hotteſt in the times of his Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Whether it were that he feared for his own part the Conſequences, with regard to his ſecond Marriage, or that he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Reformed ſhould Reproach him, with leaving the true Religion to become a Worſhipper of the Beaſt; <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> commanded abſolutely, this New Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhould be left out. The more Wiſe and Moderate of the Proteſtants, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed what was done at <hi>Gap;</hi> or at leaſt thought the Synod wanted Prudence and Moderation. The Queſtion of Antichriſt was again brought upon the Board, at the Synods of <hi>Rochell</hi> and St. <hi>Maixant.</hi> But <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IV. conſtantly oppoſed the making of an Article of Faith, which did not ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Viguier</hi> having publiſhed a Book with the Title of the <hi>Theater of Antichriſt,</hi> the Jeſuit <hi>Gontier,</hi> a famous Converter of theſe Times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it in a Violent and Seditious manner. The King forbid the publiſhing of the Book, and impoſed Silence on this Outragious Controvertiſt. <hi>Du Pleſſis Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay's</hi>

                  <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> began to take that Method, which has ſince been ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed in the Reign of her Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is ſtill in our Times. She applied her ſelf to divide the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> and weaken them; but did not refuſe her good Offices, and the young King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de la Vieuville, du Brueil</hi> Preſident of <hi>Mets,</hi> and <hi>Villers Hotman,</hi> were ſent of her part to <hi>Aix la Chappelle</hi> towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to appeaſe the Troubles raiſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before in that City. The occaſion of theſe was thus. In the year 1598. the Proteſtant Inhabitants of <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mercure Francois 1611.</note> having drove out the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, the City was put under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict of the Empire. The Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> had a Commiſſion to ſee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Orders put in Execution, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed it by the Aid of the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Cleves.</hi> So the Catholick Magiſtrates were reſtored, and the Proteſtant Miniſters in their turn, drove out of the City. The Proteſtants
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55474:116"/>ſhewing great uneaſineſs to be thus depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Exerciſe of their Religion, the Catholicks to ſtrengthen their Intereſt, put themſelves under the Protection of <hi>Albert,</hi> Arch-Duke of the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> The Revolution which hapned after in the Dutchies of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> which Countries fell into the Hands of two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes, gave ſome Conſolation to thoſe of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> who were of the ſame Religion. They went two Leagues off into a Village in the Country to pray to God, and hear his Word. This diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> The Magiſtrates forbid the Proteſtants to go into that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage upon pain of Impriſonment, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Fine. They added to this a Clauſe, that all who ſhould not be able to pay the Fine, ſhould be baniſhed out of the City.</p>
               <p>Some by Vertue of this New Law, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Impriſonment, and after were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual Baniſhment. Their Friends and Neighbours moved with Compaſſion in taking their leaves of them, went in a conſiderable Number to the Magiſtrates, when they were met to preſent a Petition in favour of thoſe poor Wretches. They alledged, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them was contrary to the Privileges of the Inhabitants, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Rigour of it to be abated. The Magiſtrates very far from conſidering this, Ordered every one to return immediately to their Reſpective Houſes. Thoſe who
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55474:117"/>were thus remanded, began to exclaim againſt the Hardſhips of the Magiſtrates, and the Jeſuits whom they lookt on as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe violent Counſels. <hi>It is now twelve years that we have groaned under this Oppreſſion,</hi> ſaid ſome of them; <hi>have we not had Patience long enough? Shall we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of Revenging three hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of our fellow Citizens, driven out of their Country in leſs than eight days time? The love of Liberty is common to Men and Brutes. But it is the Advantage of Men to have Courage and Induſtry to defend it, and recover it when it is loſt, Our Anceſtors have ever preferred Death to Slavery. Let us follow the Examples which they have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us. It is ſweeter to die, than endure Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. If God bleſs our just Efforts, for the Preſervation of our Eſtates and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, We ſhall obtain the free Exerciſe of our Religion into the Bargain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fired with this warm Speech, ſeveral run preſently to Arms, and others joyn with them. They ſieze the Town-Houſe, oblige the <hi>Burgomaſter</hi> to let out thoſe who were unjuſtly kept in Priſon, ſieze the Keys of the Gates, and put up the Chains in all parts of the City. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants being Maſters of the Town, choſe Captains, ſetled a New City Council, and took all ways they could think of, to prevent Trouble and Confuſion. Being perſuaded it would be hard to keep peace in the City, as long as any Jeſuits remained in it, the New Council ſent
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55474:117"/>Men to ſecure the good Fathers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their College. The Conſternation they were in, not giving them leave to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, they withdrew to their Church, to implore the Aſſiſtance of God, and their Great Patron <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> whom the Pope had newly Canonized. When <hi>Bigots</hi> have raſhly brought themſelves into danger by their Cabals and Indiſcreet Zeal, they have a vain confidence that God will work Miracles to bring them out. The Jeſuits were carried to the Town-Houſe, and put under a ſtrong Guard, without having any harm done them. The Superior of their profeſſed Houſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> was then at <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle</hi> to drink the Waters. He was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all imaginable Reſpect, as ſoon as he diſcovered himſelf.

               <p>The Wiſe and Moderate Catholicks diſapproved the Severity of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to the Proteſtants; ſeveral of them would not quit their Places in the City, or the Pretenſions they had to them, but ſeeing in the Concluſion they were the weakeſt, they had Recourſe to Arch-Duke <hi>Albert.</hi> The Proteſtants of their ſide, begged the Aſſiſtance of the Prince of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Newburgh,</hi> Maſters of the Neighbouring Countries of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers.</hi> Count <hi>Solms</hi> Governor there for the Princes coming to <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55474:118"/>a good number of Horſe, the Proteſtants remained abſolute in the City. And now they publiſh a Manifeſto, ſetting forth the Reaſons they had to change the Form of their ſmall Commonwealth for a time. In this they offered to agree to theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; that thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and the Reformed ſhould have free Exerciſe of their Religon; that a certain Number of Proteſtants ſhould be admitted to the Magiſtracy, with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in the laſt place, that the Jeſuits ſhould be expelled the place.</p>

                  <hi>Andrew Duval</hi> a Famous Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who was in the Intereſt of the Jeſuits and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> oppoſed the Cenſure of theſe four Propoſitions; <hi>They may be piouſly Interpreted,</hi> ſaid he. But the Enemies to the Society prevailed. What <hi>Pious Interpretation</hi> could <hi>Duval</hi> give to words which were manifeſtly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious? The three firſt Propoſitions were condemned as <hi>Falſe, Heretical, Execrable, Impious,</hi> and full of <hi>Blaſphemies.</hi> This Cenſure was more Juſt and Judicious, than that of <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornay's</hi> Book. The Wiſe Maſters of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> were more Reſerved and Circumſpect on the fourth Propoſition; the Authority of the Pope was concerned here. This contains, ſaid they, two Contradictious Poſitions. The one is true and Orthodox, that <hi>the Pope is the Vicar of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>upon Earth.</hi> But the other, that <hi>the Pope is the Lawful Succeſſor of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>is manifeſtly Falſe and Heretical.</hi> The Jeſuit was not long without anſwering.

This was to avoid ſpeaking of the Power of the Pope. His Friends, he pretended had ſent him an Article quite different from that which the Faculty had Cenſured. There is nothing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55474:127"/>more violent than the concluſion of this good Father's Apology. He Reproaches the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> as thoſe of their Society always Reproach their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they are <hi>Huguenots</hi> in their Souls. <hi>The</hi> Sorbonne <hi>Curſes the Jeſuits,</hi> ſays he, <hi>while the Hereticks at</hi> Charenton, <hi>pray to God for the</hi> Sorboniſts.</p>

He labour'd to give good Reaſons, that a Man might be a Saint without doing any. The Eſtabliſhing a Society which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo Numerous, ſo Famous and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, in ſo ſmall a time, ſeem'd a great Miracle to the Author. But this was not enough to Canonize <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and for this Reaſon, they were obliged to ſeek for others. Till this was done, <hi>Rome</hi> would never put him in her Martyrology. And what Mortification muſt this be to ſo good Children, that their Father was not a Saint of the firſt Order. As ſoon as once they got it in their Head, that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> muſt work Miracles, as well as other Saints, they found a Million of Glorious Ones. The Author who had been too honeſt, Retracted fifteen years after, as handſomly as he could. His Saint then wrought ſome every day, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſecond Edition of his Book. As for the flouriſhing Eſtate of the Company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the Death of the Founder,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55474:127"/>thoſe who ſhall read the Hiſtory of its Settlement and Progreſs, will find nothing more than Human in it; if they reflect on the Nature of Mankind, and what is proper to give Intereſt and Reputation in a Body Compoſed and Governed as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been for many Ages.</p>
               <p>I am Aſtoniſhed that Men of Senſe and Learning, ſhould become Diſciples of ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Ignatius</hi> is Repreſented to be, in the different Hiſtories of his Life, wrote by Jeſuits, with too much Sincerity in ſome places, and too much Art and Diſguiſe in others. But my Surprize is over, when I Reflect that the greateſt Men fall into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Trifling. They might fancy there was ſomething Divine in the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Fanatick Fancy of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who impoſed on the World by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſhew of Gravity and Mortification. When they ſaw this, they were ſoon ready to ſerve him in his vaſt Deſigns. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> who was Maſter of as much Craft and Diſſimulation as any Man in the World, knew how to make his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Light which the Admirers of his Sanctity gave him, and make the World believe he drew that out of his own Stock, which he learnt from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits have puſht the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance ſo far, as to compare their Saint with the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and <hi>Alexanders.</hi> They came nearer the Mark in my mind, who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55474:128"/>ſaid he was an abſolute <hi>Don Quixot</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The good Fathers muſt have an ill Opinion of Mankind, if they believe them capable of eſteeming their Founder, after what they relate themſelves of his Paladin and Romantick Actions, of his Whimſical fancy of becoming a <hi>Knight of the Virgin,</hi> and an Infinity of other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Life.<note place="margin">Vie de S. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace par le P. Bohours.</note> The reading of it politely writ in <hi>French,</hi> fully convinced me that <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> a Learned and Judicious Biſhop of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> ſaw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well the Genius of the Man, in a Conference he had with him at <hi>Rome. Ignatius</hi> there without any neceſſity told him ſo many filly Stories of his pretended Sanctity, of the Perſecutions he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in <hi>Spain,</hi> of the Revelations and Private Favours he received from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that this clearſighted Divine ſoon perceived in him, a great Diſtraction and Pride of Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canus</hi> adds one very ſingular Paſſage. <hi>Ignatius</hi> brought him a pretended Saint, who was a Member of the Infant Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Canus</hi> ſoon diſcover'd this Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was an abſolute Idiot. He mixt ſo much Folly and Hereſie in his Diſcourſe, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. <hi>This good Man,</hi> ſays he to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, is not an Heretick but his Mind is a little out of order at preſent. He has his Intervals at times. The New Moon makes him talk ſo Heretically.</hi> A Man who can let a Fool paſs on him for a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55474:128"/>great Saint, can he be very wiſe himſelf? <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> by the Jeſuits own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, had ſo ill an Opinion of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their Company, that he applied to them this Prophecy of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> In the laſt days <hi>there ſhall be Men lovers of their own ſelves, Covetous, Boaſters, falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, Blaſphemers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful, Wicked, Deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, having a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power thereof.</hi> The Character of this Prelate might be Rejected, as proceeding from a particular prejudice againſt the Jeſuits, if good Fathers had not given occaſion to a certain number of the moſt Eminent Men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, to maintain that <hi>Canus</hi> had Reaſon. The only Secret the Society has yet found to elude thoſe bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Reproaches, which are often too well proved, is to recriminate, and ſet up the cry of a <hi>Heretick</hi> againſt thoſe Adverſaries who are like to ruin them.</p>

Henry</hi> granted them Letters of <hi>Juſſion,</hi> as they are called, to the Inhabitants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. But the Town had the good Fortune or Induſtry, to fruſtrate the Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of the Jeſuits. In the year 1611. they began the Charge again. In an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly held at <hi>Troies</hi> for the Election of a New Principial of the College, the Biſhop, the Preſident, and ſome of the old Faction of the League, demanded to have the Jeſuits let in. But the Chapter of the Cathedral, that of the Collegiate Church of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the greateſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Clergy, the Preſidial, the Officers of the Town-houſe; in ſhort, all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55474:129"/>who declared for the late King in the time of the League, would have no Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its. It was to no purpoſe, to ſay the Queen had ordered they ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>In caſe it be ſo,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>we will obey. But we will firſt go and throw our ſelves at her Majeſties Feet, and make our Humble Remonſtrances to her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop then ſeeing it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Surmount ſo great an Oppoſition, broke up the Aſſembly, under colour of making farther enquiry in a more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one. This raiſed a great Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among a People jealous of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Privileges. The Jeſuits Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had privately diſpatcht away to the Court, a Curate of the City, with a Verbal Proceſs drawn up after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In this they laid before the Regent, that the Inhabitants deſired the Jeſuits for the inſtructing their Youth. As ſoon as the oppoſite Party was informed of what had paſſed, they drew up a Verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the contrary, and a Counſellor of the Preſidial was ſent away with it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Court. The Curate, who was gone ſome days before, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Letter from the Regent for the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extraordinary Meeting. This they hoped would be more favourable to the Jeſuits. When the News was ſpread through the Town, that Father <hi>Coton,</hi> who intereſſed himſelf in this Affair, had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Queen, it made a greater Noiſe than before. It was fear'd the People
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55474:130"/>would riſe. <hi>Praſlin</hi> Governor of <hi>Troies,</hi> applied himſelf with all diligence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Diſorder, and all the conſiderable Bodies in the City met to diſavow by an Authentick Act, what the Friends of the Jeſuits had done of their own Head. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thou</hi> Mayor of the City, the Dean of the Cathedral Church, and two or three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were named to go and lay their Complaints before the Regent. They ſet forth the Reaſons which they had to refuſe the good Fathers a College among them. Some of theſe were taken from the Situation, the Commerce and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the City, which would not let them admit in the Jeſuits. Others were grounded on the Humour and Behaviour of the Society, which did not ſuit with the Temper of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Theſe Honeſt Patriots ſaid, without diſguiſing the Matter, that the ſetling ſo great a number of Jeſuits in the beſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Kingdom, might ſerve to make the Society great, but was Injurious to the Publick. <hi>Since our City,</hi> added they, <hi>was reduced by</hi> Henry the IV. <hi>we have lived in perfect Tranquility. The Jeſuits will come here to revive the old Quarrels of the League. We ſhall ſoon have two contrary Factions; one influenced by the Society, who will be the Good Catholicks, and the other the true lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Country. The firſt will ever be crying, we are Hereticks, Latitudinarians, Worldly minded Men, and Lukewarm looſe Catholicks. Has not</hi> P. Binet <hi>had the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55474:130"/>to treat us in this manner, in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which he preached at</hi> Troies? <hi>No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do the Jeſuits get footing any where, but they pretend ſtrait to govern the World; they ſow Diviſions, inſinuate themſelves into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to diſcover their Secrets, what paſſes between Man and Wife, cannot eſcape their Curioſity.</hi> The Queen being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Affair of <hi>Troies,</hi> anſwered to the Petition of the Inhabitants, whoſe Deputies were preſented by the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> Governor of the Province, that ſhe had been given to underſtand, the Town deſired to have Jeſuits. <hi>Since it is not ſo,</hi> ſaid her Majeſty, <hi>I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Inhabitants to receive Men they do not like.</hi> She wrote to <hi>Praſlin</hi> to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him, and the Preſident for the future to moderate their too Impetuous Zeal for the Settlement of the good Fathers.</p>

All Men were now pretty well acquainted with the humour of that Body. A long experience had taught them, that they are not confounded with Noiſe. That Juſt and Reaſonable Confuſion, which makes other Men fearful and modeſt, encreaſes the Courage and Boldneſs of theſe good Fathers. That which moſt amazed all Honeſt Men, was to ſee the Regent and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55474:132"/>her Council give the Jeſuits Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to be confirmed in Parlement, at the ſame time that theſe Magiſtrates all well affected to the King and Government's Repoſe, declared peremptorily in their Decrees, that the Doctrines of <hi>Mariana,</hi> and ſome other Writers of the Society, had plunged the Knife in the Heart of the two laſt Kings of <hi>France.</hi> Father <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was not leſs buſie in the Hall, than at Court. He demanded the entring the King's Letters with the ſame boldneſs that he had Sollicited the Regent and her Miniſters for them. But the Rector and the Faculties of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> oppoſing this, the Deciſion of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was remitted till the following year.</p>
               <p>During a pretty long delay cauſed by the Proceedings and Formalities of Law, the Jeſuits got together four-ſcore or a hundred Scholars, whom they taught in the College of <hi>Clermont.</hi> At length the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to a publick Hearing. This was in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1611. <hi>La Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teliere</hi> Advocate for the Univerſity made a long Diſcourſe, where he repeated with Emphaſis, what <hi>Paſquier, Arnaud,</hi> and the firſt Preſident <hi>de Harlay</hi> had formerly ſaid againſt the Jeſuits. He added, all they had been accuſed of having done in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland,</hi> at <hi>Venice, Genoa</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The Divinity of theſe good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was not forgot. He ſhewed the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Danger of it. In the laſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55474:132"/>place, the Univerſity concluded by the Mouth of her Advocate, that if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement would not have regard to her wholſom Remonſtrances, ſhe ſhould at leaſt have the Conſolation of having done her Duty, and having given more than once by her repeated Oppoſitions, to the Enterprizes of the Society, a certain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of her ſincere and continual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the Service of the King, and the Good of her Coutry. <hi>Montholon</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the Jeſuits, anſwered in a very ſhort Diſcourſe. He affected too to ſpeak ſo low, that the greateſt Part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, could not hear his Defence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, <hi>Hardivillier</hi> Rector of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, ſpoke a long Harangue in Latin. This was rather the Declamation of a College Rhetorician, than a Solid and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Diſcourſe. The Advocate Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Servin</hi> ſpoke according to Cuſtom after the reſt, and concluded in favour of the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>The Parlement being tired with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of the Jeſuits, thought of a good Expedient to free themſelves. They propoſed to them to ſubſcribe to four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, repugnant to the Doctrines impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. <hi>You cannot be incorporated with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, nor have Permiſſion to teach publickly,</hi> ſaid the Magiſtrate to the good Fathers, <hi>unleſs your Sentiments agree with thoſe of the</hi> Sorbonne. This Turn was well deviſed. They foreſaw the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits would never ſign ſuch Propoſitions,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55474:133"/>for fear of incurring Diſpleaſure at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Refuſal would clear the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement at Court, for not paſſing the King's Letters. <hi>Can we,</hi> the Magiſtrates might have ſaid, <hi>allow a Body to teach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, which refuſes to ſubſcribe the Doctrine commonly received in</hi> France? The firſt Preſident <hi>de Verdun,</hi> then ordered eight Jeſuits to be called, who were in Court, to hear the iſſue of their Cauſe. <hi>Will you,</hi> ſays he to them, <hi>Subſcribe theſe four Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and undertake your General ſhall likewiſe do it?</hi> The firſt was, That <hi>a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council is above the Pope.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That <hi>the Pope has no power over the Temporalties of Sovereigns, and that he cannot deprive them by Excommunication.</hi> The third, That <hi>a Prieſt who by way of Confeſſion, comes to the Knowledge of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or Conſpiracy againſt the Perſon of a King or his Government, or any Act of High Treaſon, is obliged to Reveal the Matter to the Magiſtrate.</hi> The fourth, That <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are Subjects of the Temporal Prince, and Civil Magiſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Provincial of the Jeſuits did not know how to extricate himſelf in this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. <hi>In our Statutes,</hi> ſays he with a Modeſt and Devout Air, taking a Book and ſetting himſelf to read, <hi>We have a poſitive Order to obey the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where we live; but we cannot promiſe any thing for our General. We will write to him upon this Matter, and do all we can to obtain his conſent.</hi> The Advocate <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholon</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:55474:133"/>ſeeing what Confuſion his Clients were in, had a greater Preſence of Mind, than the good Father Provincial. <hi>The Jeſuits,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will readily follow the Laws of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity. When theſe four Propoſitions ſhall be Signed by the</hi> Sorbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, <hi>the Jeſuits will not make any ſcruple of ſubſcribing them.</hi> The dextrous <hi>Montho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> knew there were ſo many Leaguers and Doctors in the Pope's Intereſt amongſt the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> that they would never agree in theſe four Propoſitions. And if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty would have reſolved to have Signed them, the Court was ſo afraid of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope, they would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to do it. So much Reſpect and Deference had <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> for his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt Preſident himſelf embaraſſed by the Advocates Reply, would ſeem not to underſtand it; being well pleas'd that the Jeſuits had not handſomly explained themſelves, on what was propoſed to them. He pronounced a Decree, forbidding any of that Society to teach the Youth at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> or read any publick Lecture there. The Members of the Univerſity Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed, made a thouſand Verſes, ſome good, ſome bad, in praiſe of their Judges and their Advocate. The Jeſuits obeyed the Decree. They diſmiſt their Scholars, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſilent, and did not write at all, or at leaſt did it under the borrowed Names of their Friends. Here they comforted themſelves on their Diſgrace, ſhewed the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55474:134"/>Imprudence of thoſe who would renew Diſputes out of Seaſon, which might cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Differences between <hi>France</hi> and the Pope. Every Man diſcourſed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Parlement, as his Fancy led him. Some took part with the Jeſuits, others with the Univerſity. The Pope's <hi>Nuncio</hi> complained of the Parlements having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch a Subſcription of the Jeſuits. The Cardinal <hi>Gonzaga</hi> was then at <hi>Paris.</hi> He was offended the good Fathers had been ſo ill ſpoken of.<note place="margin">Mercure Francois 1612.</note> 
                  <hi>Montholon</hi> whoſe Voice was ſo low in his ſhort pleading to the Audience, printed a more ample Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the following year. This Diſcourſe was divided into three Parts. In the two firſt he juſtified the Conduct and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jeſuits. The third anſwered the Objections made againſt the Doctrine of the Society, and the Perverſe Conſequences which its Adverſaries drew from it.</p>

This was a Deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the firſt Laws of the Founder, who ordered ſhe ſhould follow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> When the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits reproached their Adverſaries with maintaining the Sentiments of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> condemned in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> they recriminated inſtantly: <hi>Your Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> ſaid they to the good Fathers, <hi>is the ſame with that of the ancient Enemies of St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>in</hi> Gaul.</p>

The one and the other formed a different Idea of what they call'd the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> or, <hi>the Reformed Doctrine.</hi> The Miniſters meant by theſe Words, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in Divinity, explained by their great Authors, and inſerted into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Faith, which the firſt Reformers had drawn up. Theſe Servants of God meant well: But they did not conſider, that by aiming in their Formularies of Faith and Catechiſms to compile a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and regular Body of Divinity, they inſerted their own Speculations as certain and eſſential Truths. The Magiſtrates and wiſe Laity of <hi>Holland</hi> urged, that the Reformation being only a purer Worſhip, and more free from vain Superſtitions than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a greater La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Opinions in things not plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Holy Writings, it could not be ſaid the Reformation ſtood on what ſome Perſons thought the moſt crabbed and difficult Queſtions of School Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters, always warm for their Opinions and Prejudiced, often cried, the Magiſtrates wanted Zeal for the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And theſe in their turn complained, that the other were ſtubborn and inflexible, and would force all the World to be of their Mind. When the Churchmen, fir'd with Zeal, brought befor the Magiſtrates thoſe who oppoſed the Hypotheſis of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:55474:136"/>and <hi>Beza,</hi> about Predeſtination and Grace, as Men who ſubverted the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Reformation, the more wiſe and diſcerning asked theſe new Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, if it were impoſſible to be a true Reformed Chriſtian without embracing the Opinions of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and his Diſciples. From the firſt Reformation in <hi>Holland,</hi> the contrary Sentiments had always prevailed in the City of <hi>Tergow.</hi> The States of <hi>Holland</hi> too had not ſolemnly approved the Confeſſion of Faith received in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches. Is not this a Proof, that thoſe wife Magiſtrates thought there were Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles put in this Formulary, which were not abſolutely neceſſary, which ought to be expreſſed in a more ſoft manner, and leſs offenſive to thoſe of a different Perſuaſion from the firſt Reformers? This appears ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, ſince we read in Hiſtory, that the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> in other reſpects ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry averſe to the Convocation of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Synod of the Seven United Provinces, conſented in the Year 1597. to the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an Aſſembly, where the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Faith ſhould be exactly reviſed and amended in a Spirit of Charity and Peace.</p>
               <p>For my own part, when I conſider the Diſputes which have cauſed ſuch a fatal Diviſion in <hi>Holland,</hi> I am in pain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how Men of Senſe can be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Opinions of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Predeſtination and Grace, are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a Reformation of Chriſtianity.

Convinced that the ſolid Proofs of <hi>Arminius,</hi> ought to make a great Impreſſion in the Minds of the States; he thought to elude the Force of them by Reproaches, which ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at bottom. <hi>Is it not a deplorable Thing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that a Profeſſor of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity ſhould inſpire into his Diſciples, the Opinions of the Jeſuits, and weaken the Proofs which our firſt Reformers brought, to ruin the Reformation by ſtrengthning the Arguments of the Papiſts againſt us.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55474:140"/>Declamations are only proper to move an ignorant Populace: Can the Jeſuits ſpeak no Truth? <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and the reſt, are they Infallible? Has the Reformation no ſolid Foundations, but the Speculative Queſtions of Grace and Predeſtination? The States did not give any great Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Gomar's</hi> Diſcourſe. His Party per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded they ſhould have more Advantage in an Aſſembly of Miniſters, perſiſted to demand, that this Diſpute ſhould be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a Synod. But the States had juſt reaſon to fear the Iſſue. The Experience of ſeveral Ages teaches us, that Councils rather increaſe, than end Diviſions.</p>
               <p>The way of Conference appeared leſs dangerous to the States. The two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> had order to come to the <hi>Hague.</hi> This happened in 1610. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> took four Miniſters with him, and <hi>Gomar</hi> as many. There in Preſence of the States of <hi>Holland, Arminius</hi> began to reduce the Controverſie to five Principal Points, which were after the five Famous Articles of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> concerning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for all Men, the neceſſity of Grace, its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on us, and Perſeverance. It was not Surprizing at the end of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to ſee what ever happens on the like occaſions. The Heat was greater than before. <hi>Arminius</hi> fell ill, and died in a few days after. His Friends and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples maintained what he had advanced.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55474:140"/>They boldly preached their Thoughts, and refuted the <hi>Gomariſts</hi> with great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Courage. Afterwards they U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited themſelves more ſtrictly, and then they concerted a Remonſtrance, to preſent in a Body to the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> they laid down their Sentiments, and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariſts</hi> on the five Articles. After this, they moſt Humbly begg'd the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the States, againſt all Sentences with which the Synods would blaſt the Perſons and Doctrines of the <hi>Arminians.</hi> Since this Remonſtrance, they had the Name of Remonſtrants given them.</p>

This did them a great deal of Miſchief. <hi>Vorſtius</hi> was ſuſpected of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and not without ſome Ground. He had publiſhed a Book, in which he ſpeaks of the Divine Nature in a very Abſurd and Groſs manner.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55474:141"/>Certificates with him. In the year 1611. there was a more famous Conference at the <hi>Hague</hi> than before, in the Preſence of the States of <hi>Holland.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen had a mind to pacifie the Troubles, without lying under a neceſſity of calling an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Synod. But Divines are not ſo eaſily ſtopt, when their Heads are once hot. There were ſix <hi>Gomariſt</hi> Miniſters on one ſide, and ſix Remonſtrants on the other. The Learned <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> was one of theſe. He has wondrouſly well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Cauſe of his Party, but has done it a great Injury too. Though he do's not think as <hi>Socinus</hi> do's of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Incarnation, the Nature and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of God; yet he maintains that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine is tolerable, and not contrary to the Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtianity. The <hi>Arminians</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> embraced the ſame Sentiment, which makes it to be believed, that <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> are near a kin. Yet theſe two things are very different. It is common in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to find Learned Divines who think in the ſame manner as <hi>Arminius</hi> did on the five Articles, and yet vigorouſly Defend the Deciſions of the four firſt General Councils.</p>

But the others alledg'd ſo much againſt him, and intervened with ſo great Oppoſition, that he continued ſtill without doing any thing, tho' the States were well affected to him.<note place="margin">Mercure Francois 1611.</note> The Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>James</hi> I.

He ſaw ſuch Shoals of Hereſies with one caſt of his Eye, he immediately ſent an Extract to his Ambaſſador to the States-General, with an expreſs Order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them from him, that if they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch a dangerous Man at <hi>Leyden,</hi> his Majeſty would publiſh a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> to ſhew the World his Averſion againſt the Authors of theſe Hereſies, and thoſe who allow them to be taught in their Univerſities.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador punctually executed his Maſter's Orders. The States-General were a little ſurprized, to ſee the King concern himſelf in an Affair that was purely Domeſtick. The Zeal which a King ſhews for the preſerving the Purity of the Faith, is not to be blamed. He
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55474:142"/>do's well to extend it beyond his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But however there are Meaſures to be kept towards his Allies and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. His <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's Threat was very high and brisk.

He wrote a long Letter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to Baniſh <hi>Vorſtius</hi> out of their Provinces. <hi>Arminius</hi> was treated in this, as an <hi>Enemy of God;</hi> and for <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> his Majeſty looked upon him as a downright Atheiſt. He concluded his Letter with threatning the States, to ſeparate from the Communion of their Churches, if they ſuffered ſo abominable a Man as <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> amongſt them.</p>
               <p>He was at <hi>Leyden</hi> before this Letter of King <hi>James</hi> came. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador made a long Remonſtrance, when he delivered it to the States-General. He gave them the Propoſitions which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

They anſwered the Ambaſſador, that the Matter in Queſtion only regarded the particular States of <hi>Holland,</hi> who were Sovereigns in their own Province. That <hi>Vorſtius</hi> was only at <hi>Leyden</hi> as a ſimple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant in the Town, and waited till he ſhould juſtifie himſelf in the next Meeting of the States of <hi>Holland.

               </p>
               <p>The States of <hi>Holland</hi> were not to meet till three or four Months after. This made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſador look upon this Delay as a Civil Denial. And now there was a New Remonſtrance from the King his Maſter to the States-General. This bad a Text after the manner of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. The Ambaſſador began with that place of the Goſpel, which orders Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Correction, and will have thoſe brought before the Church, who will not hearken to it. He complained of their want of Reſpect to the King, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Vorſtius</hi> not only in their Country,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55474:143"/>but in a Famous Univerſity. The States-General were threatned a ſecond time with a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> from his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty. Theſe Gentlemen kept their Flegm: They anſwered, the King ſhould have Satisfaction in the next Meeting of the States of <hi>Holland.</hi> This was to be in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> the following year.</p>

                  </note>Let us conclude this year with the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX. King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and ſpeak ſomething of his Elevation to the Throne. He was the youngeſt Son of <hi>Guſtavus Ericſon,</hi> ſo Famous in Hiſtory, for having delivered his Country from the Oppreſſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> for having by his Great Services, Merited the Crown to be Entailed on his Heirs Male; in ſhort, for ſetling <hi>Luther's</hi> Reformation in his Country, and Abridging the too great Power of the Clergy. <hi>Eric</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> Succeeded him, but wanted the Virtues of his Father. He introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into <hi>Sweden</hi> the Dignities of Count and Baron, which before were unknown there. It was thought this was done to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Nobility among themſelves. The too great Union of this Powerful Body, was able to create Trouble to a Family newly raiſed to the Throne. The Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities beſtowed on ſome, gave a Jealouſie to the reſt. Thoſe who had moſt Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made their Court to the King, to obtain the ſame Diſtinction. And the New Nobility were obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Authority of the King, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55474:144"/>here to his Family to preſerve their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. <hi>Eric</hi> made himſelf Odious by his Cruelties, and Deſpicable by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches and Extravagancies. His ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Finland,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sudermannia,</hi> obliged them to riſe and put themſelves at the Head of the Malecoutents. Theſe two Princes Attacked <hi>Eric</hi> in <hi>Stockholm</hi> it ſelf. He firſt delivered up his Favourite, whom all the Kingdom Exclaimed againſt. They inflicted an Infamous puniſhment on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than all this. They agreed to take the Sovereign Power from <hi>Eric,</hi> who abuſed it unjuſtly, and that the Duke of <hi>Finland</hi> ſhould be declared King, and the Duke of <hi>Sudermannia</hi> ſhould ſhare with him in the Government, without having any outward Marks of Royalty. <hi>John</hi> thought himſelf now diſcharged from the Oath he had taken, when <hi>Eric</hi> delivered him out of a cloſe Priſon, where he had kept him three or four years. The Duke had given Aſſurance by a Writing under his Hand, that he would continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the King, and not aſpire to the Crown, neither before nor after the Death of the King his Elder Brother, and that he would acknowledge thoſe Children for lawful Heirs of the Kingdom, which <hi>Eric</hi> had by a Miſtreſs of Mean Birth, whom he afterwards Marryed Solemnly.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55474:144"/>But <hi>John</hi> was not very anxious about the Religious obſerving his Promiſes. When he was Maſter of his Eldeſt Brother, not contented with ſhutting him up in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he ſoon poiſoned him. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> continued to attack <hi>Stockholm.</hi> The Senate of the City delivered it up to them, and poor <hi>Eric</hi> reduced to Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, was left to the Diſcretion of his two Brothers. The States of <hi>Sweden</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him fallen from the Crown, and <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Finland</hi> was ſet up in his place.</p>

I ſhall only obſerve, that the King who wanted not Wit or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was convinced there were a great many things to be altered in the Worſhip and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He can neither be reckoned among the good Catholicks, nor the true Proteſtants.

The Mixture of theſe two Religions, was one of the ways by which this Prince pretended inſenſibly to bring the People to forſake the Worſhip and Belief of the Proteſtants of the <hi>Ausburgh</hi> Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Several <hi>Romiſh</hi> Churchmen came into <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Irreſolution of King <hi>John</hi> and his Indulgence drew them thither.

               <p>The States of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhew'd great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on ſeveral Occaſions. They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King, that mighty Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were riſen in <hi>Sweden</hi> and Foreign Countries; that his Majeſty would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow that Conſtitution which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had wiſely eſtabliſhed; and that to put an end to all thoſe Rumours, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him to declare publickly, that the Reformation received in that Kingdom, was conformable to the Senſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. Farther, the States com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſeveral Popiſh Books brought into that Country, to be ſuppreſs'd; they preſs'd the King to place able Men of unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd Reputation in the Publick Schools to inſtruct the Youth. In the laſt place they deſired, that <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> the King's eldeſt Son ſhould be bred in the Proteſtant Religion, becauſe that young Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to give ſome Umbrage. Queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Jagellon,</hi> his Mother, had ſo ſtrongly tinctured him with the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Senators, of the Kingdom having one day threatned him that he ſhould loſe the Right of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55474:146"/>Succeſſion to the Crown if he did not ſoon renounce the Religion he had imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and embrace the <hi>Ausburgh</hi> Confeſſion. <hi>I prefer,</hi> replied he boldly, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven to all the Crowns in the World.</hi> No other Anſwer could be got from him.</p>
               <p>On ſome Occaſions the States of <hi>Sweden</hi> had more Complaiſance for the King. All ſeem'd diſpos'd to receive the new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and the Accommodations he had invented. <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sudermannia,</hi> the Clergy of his Provinces, and ſome great Lords, were the only People who defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reformation; but the Intereſt of the Duke, and the effectual Remonſtrances of the reſt, brought back ſeveral, whoſe Hopes and Fears had abated their Warmth and Zeal. The King himſelf had loſt much of that Ardor the Jeſuit <hi>Poſſevin</hi> had inſpired into him. Whether he could not accommodate himſelf to the haughty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. Succeſſor to <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, or his Doubts were not ſufficiently cleared, or the great Power of his Brother kept him in awe; <hi>John</hi> humbled the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, who thought themſelves now Maſters of all things. He drove out the Jeſuits, and demoliſhed their College. <hi>Gennila Bielke,</hi> whom the King married after the Death of <hi>Catherine Jagellon,</hi> cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fervour her Husband had before ſhewed for the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. Kings often think they do that of their own Heads, which a dextrous and inſinuating
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55474:147"/>Woman inſpires into them. <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> thought he had ſolid Reaſons to doubt of the Truth of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But his principal Motive, though he ſcarce knew it himſelf, was, his great Complaiſance for <hi>Catherine Jagellon.</hi> The Queen <hi>Gennila</hi> might have brought him back to his firſt Religion, in the ſame manner as the other had ſeduced him from it.</p>

                     <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> Prince of <hi>Sweden</hi> is choſen King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
                  </note>After the Death of <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> King of <hi>Poland, Ann Jagellon</hi> his Widow, and Aunt of <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> Prince of <hi>Sweden</hi> managed the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility ſo well, that the greateſt part declared for him. The contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction choſe the Arch-Duke <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Brother to the Emperor <hi>Rodolphus.</hi> But <hi>Sigiſmond</hi>'s Friends carried it. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>Poland,</hi> beat the Arch-Duke; and <hi>Maximilian</hi> being taken Priſoner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his Liberty, by renouncing all his Pretenſions to the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> The <hi>Swedes</hi> made their Conditions before the Prince left that Kingdom; as the <hi>Poles</hi> made theirs before they received him. The Principal thing which the Senate of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſtipulated with <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> was, the preſerving the Priviledges and Religion of their Country. They added this Clauſe in the Treaty, that if the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> becoming King of <hi>Sweden</hi> after the Death of his Father, ſhould contravene any of the Articles agreed on, that then the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould be diſcharged from the Oath of Allegiance they had taken.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:55474:147"/>
               <p>It is very probable that <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> before his departure from <hi>Sweden,</hi> urged the King his Father to purſue his Deſign of cauſing his new Liturgy to be received, together with the ancient Ceremonies which he had eſtabliſh'd a little after his coming to the Crown. When Princes have begun a Work that makes a great Figure, they are loth to quit it, and ſoon reſume it, when they ſee the leaſt Proſpect of Succeſs. <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> hoped his late Advancement would make it eaſie for him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the Work which his Father had drawn a rough Draught of: And the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſtrengthned by the new Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Poland,</hi> flatter'd himſelf, that <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sudermannia</hi> would not dare to oppoſe him. He was deceived in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures. The Churchmen of the Dutchy agreeing perfectly well with the Prince, refuſed to receive his Liturgy. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the King ſo much, who was now at greater variance with his Brother than ever, that he thought of recalling <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in earneſt. The new King himſelf was tempted to return into his Country. He would willingly have done it, if the <hi>Poles</hi> had not briskly oppoſed it. A Foreign Prince is eaſily dazled with the glittering Title of King of <hi>Poland:</hi> But he ſoon takes diſtaſte at the falſe Luſtre of a Crown which only appears fair at a diſtance. Thoſe who have left their Hereditary Countries to go into <hi>Poland,</hi> have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55474:148"/>This is the way to hazard the loſs of an Effective Sovereignty for a Title which has more Pomp than Reality. <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> knew by Experience the Truth of this Maxim.</p>
               <p>The King, his Father, finding ſo great oppoſition from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were more upon their Guard ſince the Election of <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> had nothing elſe to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, but to reconcile himſelf ſpeedily to the Duke of <hi>Sudermannia,</hi> and admit him to a Share in the Adminiſtration of Affairs. The Apprehenſions of <hi>John</hi> were ſomething leſſened by <hi>Charles</hi>'s loſing his Wife. She left no Iſſue behind her; and <hi>John</hi> pretended his Brother promiſed him never to think of a ſecond Marriage. If it were ſo, the Duke in his turn broke his Word. He ſoon after married <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Adolphus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> It is reported, <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> courted this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before he went into <hi>Poland.</hi> But a Siſter of King <hi>John</hi> diverted the Prince her Nephew from the Match. He after married <hi>Conſtance</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Charles,</hi> and Siſter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Gratz</hi> in <hi>Stiria. Chriſtina,</hi> enraged at this Contempt, conceived ſo great a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> that after ſhe was married to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sudermmannia,</hi> ſhe inceſſantly urged him to force the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> from <hi>Sigiſmond.</hi> King <hi>John</hi> was not well ſatisfied with this ſecond Marriage of <hi>Charles.</hi> But his ill Humour did
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55474:148"/>not laſt long. He died ſoon after at <hi>Stockholm.</hi>

                  <hi>John</hi> left another Son by his ſecond Wife; but he was yet a Minor.

               <p>Soon after his Departure, the States of <hi>Swedeland</hi> pray'd <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sudermannia,</hi> to take upon him the Government. The Duke deſired to be excuſed; yet decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the ſame time, that neither his
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55474:151"/>Conſcience, nor the Love he bore his Country, could ever permit him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Orders left by his Nephew; yet notwithſtanding his ſeeming Modeſty, the Duke wanted only to be further court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Matter. The Senate was to have almoſt an equal ſhare with him in the Government, and Governors of Towns did exerciſe a ſort of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Juriſdictions. The King had contrived it ſhould be ſo, as a neceſſary precaution to ballance his Uncle's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to leſſen his Power. Such a Scheme of Government was not for the Duke's turn. He expected that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators would abate ſomewhat of their Rights and Privileges, and that more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would be allowed him over the Governors of each City. Matters were accordingly brought to that paſs, as he would have it. The Duke then, as if he had only yielded to the repeated Addreſs of the Senate, ſlides into the Saddle of State, and marches to <hi>Stokholm:</hi> Then, he was wont to ſay, <hi>That the beſt way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at that juncture, was to put into execution what the King was indeſpenſably bound to perform himſelf.

The Senators on th'other hand complained, that he did all things after his own fancy, and dealt harſhly with ſuch as oppoſed his Deſigns in the leaſt. <hi>Charles</hi> alledged, that they did waſt the Publick Revenue; and had fomented Miſunderſtanding betwixt the King and him, with a deſign (as it ſhould ſeem) to ruin both his Majeſty and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they themſelves might thereby become ſole Maſters. He made a ſhew of laying down the Adminiſtration of Affairs that was committed to him; but was extreamly ſurpriſed when he found not one of the Senate oppoſed that his ſeeming Reſolution. Therefore conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf, that he had gone too far to retreat (in hopes to ſlip his Neck out of the Collar) he again laid hold of the Helm of publick Affairs. He Summon'd a General Aſſembly of the Senates to be held at <hi>Arboga.</hi> There the Senate with many of the Nobility formed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Party, in oppoſition to that of the

But <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond</hi> would not truſt him. He reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the ruine of an Uncle, who openly aſpired to no leſs than the Crown.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55474:154"/>Theſe two Princes was each of 'em at the Head of his own Army, and there was great likelihood that the Fate of one Battle, would decide the Quarrel. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond</hi> was ſo overſeen, that his Camp was ſurpriſed at <hi>Linkoping.</hi> Part of his Army was kill'd, and ſome drown'd.

The two Princes concluded a Treaty: <hi>Charles</hi> renewed his Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the King.

               <p>Then it was that <hi>Charles</hi> ſent a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge by a Herald at Arms to King <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:</hi> Copies of it were ſpread abroad in all Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> After ſome hard and reproachful Expreſſions that <hi>Charles</hi> uſes againſt his Enemy, <hi>Since you are at the Head of your Army</hi> (ſaid he to him) <hi>Let us ſpare the innocent Blood of our Subjects; let us decide our Quarrel in a ſingle Combat, after the laudable Cuſtom of the</hi> Grecians <hi>of old. I challenge you to it: If you decline fighting, I'll never look on you to be a Man of Honour, or a gallant Soldier.</hi> But the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s Anſwer was much more abuſeful. He declared, <hi>That whatever</hi> Charles <hi>charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55474:158"/>him with, was but a parcel of impudent Lyes, vended by one who was better at ſuch Railings than at downright fighting at the Head of his Army.

Diſcours du Duc de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han ſur l'Etat de la France Apres ſes Memoires in 40.</note> did therefore foment Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions both at Court and throughout the Kingdom; She created Jealouſies, and gave Umbrage to the beſt Allies the Crown had; and raiſed the ſinking Spirits of her Sons moſt formidable Enemies. The Confederacy with <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> had been the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark and Strength of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe Princes who were Apprehenſive of the too great Power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> were enter'd into a League with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed King. The good Correſpondency that he took care to maintain in this ſort of a Confederacy which he Headed, did keep <hi>Spain</hi> in awe, and within due bounds. This put <hi>Henry</hi> in a capacity of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any thing, whenever he ſhould think it moſt expedient. But ſo ſoon as theſe Allies of <hi>France</hi> perceived that the Queen Regent was entring into a ſtrict Alliance with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55474:160"/>grew Jealous, and betook themſelves to other Meaſures. The <hi>Venetians</hi> did not ſo openly declare themſelves. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> extream angry that no regard was now had of the Treaties that had been made between King <hi>Henry</hi> and him; ſought all manner of ways to raiſe Commotions in <hi>France,</hi> he had thoughts of ſiding with <hi>Spain,</hi> if he might be ſecured of any thing to content his Ambition. <hi>France</hi> taking no care to preſerve the old good Correſpondency that was between the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſewhere, they fell off, one from another. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> that has always a watchful Eye to its own Intereſt, was wiſe enough to make the beſt of theſe Diviſions. <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> might have in this caſe, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Place of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, and compel'd the Queen Regent to keep to the Model of Government that was left with her by the late King her Husband. The concern of the Proteſtant Religion, as well as the Wellfare of <hi>England,</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that <hi>James</hi> ſhould have at that time, thought on't better. But alas, the good Prince never lov'd ſincerely either one, or th'other. Such a State of Affairs as this, did well for the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Popes have been ever <hi>Spaniards</hi> by Inclination. The Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> are wont to bring the Popes over to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by affecting a great Zeal to ruine Hereſie. The aim of theſe, is to raiſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55474:161"/>their Worldly State; and of the former, to ſerve thoſe that will beſt contribute to reſtore their Spiritual Monarchy. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Court of <hi>France</hi> at this time was pleaſed with this old policy of <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby to gain the Popes favour. But was it not a little too late to think of this way? The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> never keeps a Neutrality with <hi>France,</hi> but when reduced to it by ſome emergent Neceſſity. The <hi>French</hi> have Principles that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Pope's Pretenſions, and to the greedineſs of his Courtiers.</p>
               <p>The Factions which had formerly put <hi>France</hi> into ſuch a Confuſion, under the Regency of <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> were now ſeen to revive under this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Mary.</hi> For the maintaining of her own Authority, <hi>Mary</hi> took care to bring down the Princes of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as that other Queen her Couſin had done before. She thought fit to make uſe of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which enter'd into a new Knot with that of the Duke <hi>d'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon.</hi> Inſtead of joyning with the real Friends, and Well-wiſhers of the Crown, ſhe gave her ſelf over to be led by the Popes, and King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Counſels, who could not grow great, but at the coſt of young <hi>Lewis.</hi> The Princes of the blood underſtood this great Evil. They were in the Right, but in renouncing their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Religion, they had loſt all their Credit. They likewiſe wanted Strength to oppoſe the Queen Regent's Deſigns.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55474:161"/>They of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France</hi> being well inclin'd, ſought to prevent the Miſchief this double Alliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> would bring on the Head of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. But alas, how could they help themſelves? There were now, no Princes of the Blood to Head them any more. The Grandees of that Communion divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more than ever, ſince the Aſſembly at <hi>Saumur,</hi> were now ready to undoe one another. I come now to particulars, of the Hiſtory of the year 1612. We ſhall in it begin to ſee theſe three different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties following, their Intrigues, and the different condition they are in. The Queen Regent and her Confidents, ſhall make uſe of the Kings Authority to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their wicked Deſigns. The Princes of the Blood ſhall exclaim againſt the ill Management of the Government; but either no ear ſhall be given to what they'll ſay, or their Mouths ſhall be ſtopt by falſe Promiſes, or ſlight Gratifications.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55474:163"/>and ſo becoming a true <hi>Frenchman,</hi> did not a little contribute to haſten the Dukes Diſgrace.

Marquemont</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> was ſtoutly buſie on his part with the Miniſters and Prelates. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> happening one day to be in the Queen's Cloſet with Cardinal <hi>Gonzaga</hi> and <hi>Perron;</hi> this latter had the boldneſs to tell the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate General, that he was an ignorant Fellow: The Cardinal was become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly proud from the Applauſes, which his eaſie way of ſpeaking and writing had procured him from the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are rather dazled by the falſe appearance of a brisk and lively fancy, than convinc'd by any ſolid Reaſonings, which the greateſt part of Men are not capable to diſcern. The remains we have of <hi>Servin,</hi> and the Cardinal ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prove that the Advocate General knew near as much as <hi>Perron.</hi> At leaſt this Magiſtrate had greater Integrity of of Mind, and Sincerity. The Subtile Cardinal dar'd not to take up the Cudgels againſt <hi>Servin,</hi> upon the Pope's Authority or Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church; He could not have got the better of him, but he fell upon the Article, touching the Seal
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55474:171"/>of Confeſſion, and as the Cardinal was a great Pratler and Sophiſter, he entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the queſtion after ſuch a manner, for to find Hereſies in what the Advocate General had ſaid, as <hi>Servin</hi> being put to a Nonplus, deny'd what the Cardinal had laid to his Charge.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Gonzaga</hi> not content to have given a Memoir to the Queen againſt <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> had a mind to affront him in her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. He call'd <hi>Servin</hi> Heretick, the King's, Queen's, and States Enemy. The Advocate General reply'd without being mov'd, that his Office obliged him to be careful of what concern'd the Intereſt of his Maſter, and the good of the Realm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know, Sir,</hi> he added, <hi>That you have the Honour to be Related to her Majeſty. The Quality of being the Queen's Nephew, makes me have a Reſpect for you; but I am not to give an account of my Behaviour, to any beſides the Queen. Gonzaga</hi> anſwer'd, that the beſt Service <hi>Servin</hi> could do the King, was never to ſwerve from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, and not to divide <hi>France</hi> and the Holy Chair, and that one could not be a good Servant to the King, and an Enemy to the Pope at the ſame time. Before you preſcribe us Leſſons, ſaid <hi>Servin,</hi> being incen'ſt at the Cardinal's boldneſs, who led a Scandalous Life at <hi>Paris, you ought to conſider,</hi> Sir, <hi>of ſhewing us good Examples.</hi> The Queen preſently interrupted the Advocate General, and diſmiſſing of him, order'd him to give the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55474:172"/>Cardinal Satisfaction. <hi>I don't require any,</hi> reply'd, Gonzaga, <hi>this Man is not in a capacity to give me any Offence.</hi> Poor eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Grandee, whom the Truth of a Reproach had touch't to the quick!</p>
               <p>The Prelates who were at <hi>Paris,</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſet themſelves likewiſe a crying againſt the Edict of Parlement, and the Advocate General.

The Biſhops too did not well agree amongſt themſelves upon the Article of Confeſſion. They believ'd, that they had not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough to declare in a private Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, upon a queſtion of this Importance; neither had they the boldneſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldini</hi> had better luck at the <hi>Sorbonne;</hi> He form'd there a Cabal nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous enough to hinder the <hi>Paris</hi> faculty from declaring upon the Articles: Dr. <hi>Duval</hi> at the Head of his Party promis'd
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55474:172"/>to anſwer, in caſe the Parlement preſs't them to it, that the Faculty could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Biſhops, or without an expreſs Order from the Queen; that the Articles in queſtion had not only a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Religion, but to State Affairs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. In the mean time the Jeſuits were at a ſtand, they long'd to open their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of <hi>Clermont:</hi> To obtain this Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<note place="margin">The Jeſuits puzl'd how they could content the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement at the ſame time.</note> they were to follow the Advice which the Preſident <hi>Seguier</hi> their good Friend, and ſome others, gave to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which was, to content the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Promiſe, to conform to the Doctrine generally received in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> But this expoſed them too, to the Indignation of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelates, Counſell'd them not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Parlement ſo far. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldini</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them from it, being perſuaded, that the Honour of the Holy Chair was concern'd in this Affair. After great Conſults, the Provincial accompanied by five other Jeſuits, goes without giving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> or Cardinals, to make a Declaration in Writing before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of Parlement, like to that which the Provincial had made in Parlement, <hi>vivâ voce.</hi> The good Fathers believed, they ſhould eaſily Extricate themſelves in this Affair with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the thing was done, and ſhould eſcape with only a chiding from the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55474:173"/>their General, who would not be ſorry for it at the bottom of his Heart.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Nuncio</hi> had underſtood what the Jeſuits had done, he was in a furious Paſſion. Father <hi>Coton</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to wait on him, to Appeaſe him. The oily Tongu'd Jeſuit repreſented to him to little purpoſe, that his Provincial did not think to do any Miſchief in ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had already ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Rules of the Society required, it ſhould conform to the Sentiments of the Univerſities, where it had Colleges; that their good Friends counſell'd them to prevent the Troubles which the Parlement would not fail to give them, if the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſhould obſtinately refuſe to obey the Edict; Laſtly, that they had believ'd the Pope to have Reaſons, why he did not give them expreſly Permiſſion, to ſubmit to a Law which the Parlement would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon them, but that they hop'd the Pope would not take it ill from them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to have contented the Parlement, without the knowledge of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Nuncio</hi> was not paid with theſe Reaſons. <hi>Doth it belong to you, ſaid he to</hi> Coton, <hi>to gueſs the Intentions of his Holineſs? You ſhould have conſulted his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who knows them better than any one elſe. And ſince you ought to conform to the Sentiments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, why have you not tarried till the</hi> Sorbonne <hi>explain'd clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it believes? In ſtead of conſulting your Preſident</hi> Seguier, <hi>and the Lawyers,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55474:173"/>it might have been more expedient to have taken mine, and the Prelates their Advice, who have good Intentions, and have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orders from your Father General. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> had nothing to reply; but the buſineſs was over. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> likewiſe could not further complain to the Queen, of the violence the Parlement had done the Jeſuits; for one might have anſwer'd him, that the good Fathers went of their own accord, without any new Summons, to promiſe to conform to the Sentiments of the Univerſity, and Intentions of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement. As Equivocations, Silence keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Mental Reſervation, are always the Society's great help; the Jeſuits of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> made wonderful uſe of them in the Letters they wrote to the Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Borgheſe</hi> his Nephew. Can any one forbear laughing, and ſee <hi>Coton</hi> ſpeaking down right to his Holineſs, that by the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, they underſtood nothing but the Concordate made betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> X. and <hi>Francis</hi> I.</p>

The firſt was but a Collection of ſome Decrees of the Faculty at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon the Authority of the Pope. T'was intended to prove herein, that the ancient Doctrine of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:55474:174"/>is, That Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted <hi>an Ariſtocratical Government</hi> in his Church. And becauſe the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> accuſeth all thoſe of Huguenotiſm, who oppoſe it's Uſurpations, the Author of this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was willing to prevent this Reproach againſt the Faculty, in joyning to his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Decrees againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>du Pleſſis Mornai.</hi> The ſecond Book unfolds the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical</hi> Government of the Church. The Title of the Book is, <hi>Of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Politick Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author pretended that Spiritual Juriſdiction belongs properly to the Church, and that the Pope and Biſhops are but the Inſtruments and Miniſters whom ſhe makes uſe of, to exerciſe this Juriſdiction; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Head of the Church, of which the Pope is only Head Miniſterial, as they term it, and that the Authority of the Pope extends only to particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where he is to ſee, that the Decrees and Canons publiſh't in General Councils be obſerv'd; that the Church ought not to be govern'd by one Abſolute Monarch, but by the Canons; that Infallibility is given to the Church in general, that is to ſay, to the Body of the chief Paſtors, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Biſhop and Pope likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to Error; that the frequent calling of General Councils is neceſſary; that the Decrees of the Pope oblige no further, than they are Conformable to the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55474:174"/>Canons; Laſtly, that the Pope cannot impoſe any Obligation upon the Church againſt her will, and without her conſent to it.</p>
               <p>As to politick Power the Author main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that Jeſus Chriſt hath given no Temporal Juriſdiction to the Church, and that ſhe hath not any power to uſe the <hi>Sword,</hi> or Conſtraint; that Cenſures and Excommunications are the Spiritual Arms of the Church, and that they could not heretofore be employ'd, without the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Aſſembly, which they call'd <hi>Presbyters;</hi> that the King is the Defender and Protector of the Natural, Divine, and Canonical Law, and that in this Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he hath right to make Laws, and uſe the <hi>Sword</hi> to maintain, what God and the Councils have ordain'd; that Chriſtian Emperors have by Right call'd the firſt General Council: That Appeals as <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from Abuſe</hi> or <hi>Error</hi> are lawful, and that Sovereigns ought to receive them in quality of being Protectors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; that the Church hath an indirect Power over Temporal Matters, by way of Perſuaſion and Excommunication, but not by way of Conſtraint and Depoſition of Sovereigns; that the Decrees of Popes, wherein Sovereigns who don't Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Hereticks, are Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have no more Authority, than the Decrees of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. and other Conſtitutions of Ambitious and Uſurping Popes; that the Examples of Emperors
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55474:175"/>and Princes Excommunicated and Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Popes, are facts which can't prove a Right lawfully acquired. And ſo this Work ended in ſubmitting all theſe Propoſitions, to the Judgment of the Church.</p>

The other Doctor was much blam'd, becauſe he was in League with a Foreigner, to procure by extraordinary ways an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the faculty at <hi>Paris,</hi> which was to Deliberate upon a Work, where the Author treated of many Important Queſtions, touching the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement put forth another Act, to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Faculty from proceeding to the Examination of <hi>Richer</hi>'s Book, and to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55474:175"/>order, that all the Copies ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Regiſtry of Parlement. The moſt Prudent and moſt Apprehenſive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors declared themſelves for <hi>Richer,</hi> but <hi>Duval</hi> and ſome hot Spirited Men, penn'd bloody Books againſt him.<note place="margin">The Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> and the Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Sens,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>'s Book in an Aſſembly.</note> The outcry was ſo furious, as they threatned him with nothing leſs than Tranſportation to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſending of him to the Inquiſition, to be burn't there afterwards. The greateſt and moſt dangerous Enemy of <hi>Richer,</hi> was Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> puſh't on by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> and the <hi>Nuncio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldini: Perron</hi> had the Malice to ſay in the Queen's Council, that he had been a long time heretofore in the party of the League, that he did not ſet the Council above the Pope, but becauſe he ſuppoſed that the States General are above Kings; Laſtly, that he had it in his Eye, to fling at the birth of the King and his State, with the Children of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and the Validity of the Marriage of the late King with the Queen Mother. <hi>Richer</hi> ask't leave to defend himſelf againſt the Calumnies of the Cardinal; but the <hi>Nuncio</hi> made ſo great a noiſe on his ſide, as ſo juſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt could not be granted him. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> even threatned to depart preſently from <hi>Paris,</hi> without taking his leave of the King.

T'was thus, that the Grandees imagined their Elevation gave them right to pay others with moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Anſwers.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of <hi>Richer</hi> ſeeing there was nothing to do in the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Parlement, they ſought ſome other Means to ſtain the Reputation of this good Man.

An occaſion was taken to preſent <hi>Richer</hi>'s Book to this ſort of Provincial Council. The Preſident fail'd not to have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd there, <hi>as containing many falſe Propoſitions Erroneous, Scandalous, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Heretical, without touching howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>the Rights of the King and Crown of</hi> France, <hi>or the Rights, Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Liberties of the</hi> Gallican <hi>Church!</hi> Never was there a more Irregular Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than this. The Prelates had not power to Aſſemble, but upon ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55474:176"/>Temporal Affairs of the Clergy of their Province; The pretended Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Council was not therefore call'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rightful Form. Of eight Biſhops who compos'd it, five Signed the Condemnation, without having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Examination of the Book: One might have been ſurpriz'd, to find there the Name of <hi>Gabriel de l'Aubeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> well known by his Books, wherein he endeavours to clear ſome curious Paſſages of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, if one did not otherwiſe know, that this Prelate was a Courtier, who led a Diſorderly Life. The Biſhop <hi>of Orleans,</hi> they were won't to ſay in thoſe days, <hi>is writing for the Church, when he hath no more Money to game withal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parlement having taken in hand the Affair of <hi>Richer</hi>'s Book, the Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Sens</hi> could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon it without encroaching upon the King and Parlement's Authority. They ought to ſend for the Author, and hear his Defence. At laſt the Cardinals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and abſolv'd at the ſame time. All the Propoſitions pretended to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and heretical in <hi>Richer</hi>'s Book, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the Rights of the King, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church; and this was the reaſon why the Fathers of the Council would not meddle: 'Twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from their Knowledge and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they would have declared to the Publick, <hi>Richer</hi>'s Hereſies, which have no
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55474:177"/>Relation to the Rights of the Crown, and Privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. <hi>Gondi</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> having cauſed to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh't in all his Pariſhes the Decree of the Council, where he was preſent, <hi>Richer</hi> appealed as from an Abuſe. He preſented a Relief of Appeal to be Sealed, but they refuſed him the Letters he askt for, without any regard to the good Reaſons he alledg'd, in offering to juſtifie himſelf: The Cabal was ſo ſtrong, as the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dared not receive the Petition which <hi>Richer</hi> had preſented, to demand from the Court, that they would be pleaſed to order his Letters of Relief ſhould be Sealed. <hi>Perron</hi> was too ſubtile to ſuffer, that the Decree of his Provincial Council ſhould be examin'd in Parlement.

               <p>King <hi>James</hi> was eaſily made to believe, that <hi>France</hi> thought of nothing but the General good of Chriſtianity, by making this double Allyance with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the Regent would not leſs preſerve the Amity of Princes and the States Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. <hi>Bouillon</hi> endeavour'd at laſt to make his Majeſty underſtand, that the Pope would not uſe violent means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants, and that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to Convert them by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the good Examples of the Clergy.

What paſs't in the Aſſembly at <hi>Saumur,</hi> exaſperated ſo much the Mareſchal againſt the Duke, that <hi>Bouillon</hi> undertook to throw out <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> from the Government of St. <hi>John d' Angeli,</hi> which the Deceaſed King had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon him: The Duke <hi>de Rohan</hi> being well advis'd of the evil Offices that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55474:189"/>were conſtantly done him at Court, went to juſtifie himſelf. After having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Regent, that he had behav'd as a good Man in the Aſſembly at <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. I confeſs to you,</hi> Madam, ſaid the Duke, <hi>that I oppos'd the Deſigns of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> de Bouillon: <hi>But this was done but in order to give your Majeſty freſh Tokens of my Fidelity and Zeal, which I have for your Service. I Diſtruſt thoſe Perſons who turn Scales, and pay their Services on both Sides: 'Tis ſeldom known, that ſuch Men are upright in their Intentions. If Monſieur</hi> Bouillon <hi>had brought his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns about in our Aſſembly at</hi> Saumur, <hi>he might have underſtood how to have uſed them, and prevailed even againſt your ſelf. When Monſieur</hi> Bouillon <hi>comes to be the Maſter amongſt us, your Authority ſhall be never the better Eſtabliſhed in this Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prov'd the Truth of a Reflection which he himſelf made, <hi>viz. That a Prince who hath a prejudicate Opinion, is hard to be perſwaded.</hi> The Regent gave no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to theſe Remonſtrances. The time now of the Election of the Mayor of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Angeli</hi> was near. It was a thing of the greateſt Importance that could be to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he who was in the place might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. The adverſe Party to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, had got over this Man to their ſide; and if their Project had ſucceeded, the Duke had loſt all his Authority in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55474:190"/>the place: Feigning then that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dangerouſly ſick, he took a Journey ſuddenly from <hi>Paris. Rohan</hi> took <hi>Soubize</hi> in his way, and they both got to St. <hi>John d' Angeli.</hi> The day of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being come, a Letter under the King's Privy Seal was produc't, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Major ſhould continue; this not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be any Rule for the future, and to be without prejudice to the Privileges of the Inhabitants. The Duke <hi>de Rohan</hi> Remonſtrated, that her Majeſty had been ill inform'd of the State of the City, where there was not any thing at all of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the Letter under the King's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal had ſuppos'd, and that they might proceed to a new Election, according to the accuſtom'd Form; <hi>I hope</hi> ſaid he; <hi>I ſhall bring her Majeſty to agree to it: To this effect I ſend my Secretary to Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mareſchal <hi>Bouillon</hi> flatter'd himſelf, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> would infallibly loſe himſelf, whatever Party he would take, in an Affair that was ſo tickliſh for him to manage: If <hi>Rohan</hi> ſuffers the former Major to be continued, they wou'd ſtrip him of all his Authority, and if he oppos'd the Court's Orders, this would find it ſelf in a neceſſity of puniſhing a Man who neglected to obſerve the Authority of the King: To engage the Queen after ſuch a manner, as ſhe ſhould not flinch back for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Mareſchal perſwaded her to ſend a more expreſs Order for to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the old Major. But the Duke of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55474:190"/>
                  <hi>Rohan</hi> being perſwaded, that if he loſt the Government, he himſelf was loſt without any Redemption; believ'd, that he ought not to obey the Orders which the Queen had ſent, as being Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed unwarily by his Enemies: A New Major was choſen; that is to ſay, three Perſons were Nominated, whoſe Names were ſent to the Court, to the end her Majeſty might pitch upon one whom ſhe judg'd moſt proper for the place: Whilſt they were expecting an Anſwer from the Regent, the Keys of the Town were put into the Hands of the Eldeſt Alderman, and thus the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of the Town; from whence he caus'd ſome <hi>Subaltern</hi> Officers to be put out, who were againſt him.</p>
               <p>This bold Action mightily ſtir'd up the Queen againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan?</hi> Thoſe whom he had ſent to Court, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> T'was forbid the Dutcheſs his Mother, his Wife, his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to ſtir out of <hi>Paris.</hi> Some Perſons propoſed to the Counſel, that t'was fit to go and Beſiege the Duke in St. <hi>John d' Angeli,</hi> as a Rebel: Orders were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't for raiſing Troops, and ſending the Artillery. The Queen publiſh't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that ſhe would go her ſelf in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Army, which the Mareſchal <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to make the Reformed know, that there was no point of Religion here in Queſtion, but only a Chaſtiſment of a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55474:191"/>particular Lord, who had Revolted from his Obedience: The Duke as ſoon as he underſtood this, publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> which he Addres't to the Reform'd Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; he gave them notice that his Zeal for their Preſervation, brought upon him this Perſecution; that the loſs of St. <hi>John d' Angeli</hi> drew along with it other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Retreat and Security, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies wou'd not ſtop in ſo fair a way, after they had taken from him his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.<note place="margin">Mercure Francois, 1612.</note> The <hi>Manifeſto</hi> ended with a lively Exhortation; The Duke complain'd, becauſe his Enemies had made Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Conduct, and that having found him irreprovable, they had inform'd againſt ſome Gentlemen, who were not at all faulty of any other Crime, than his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a Viſit: <hi>The Court,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>fears that our divided Body will reunite, the Reputation Monſieur</hi> de Rohan <hi>hath acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Quality and Probity, which he hath always made profeſſion of, gives <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage; muſt they for this cauſe apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by little and little to weaken our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to undoe us by Peacemeals? Let us know our ſelves, if we would Live and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: Let us revive the good Intelligence which was heretofore amongſt us: Let us Devote our ſelves to the Service of our God and our King: Let us work for the Good of our Church, and the State: We were the moſt judicious and conſiderable Party, before our Diviſions at</hi> Saumur. This great Man, who knew better to Fight than to Write,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55474:191"/>not ſtanding upon <hi>Manifeſto's</hi> only, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd himſelf for a courageous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Another Manifeſto was publiſh'd on the Queen's ſide. She took great care therein to advertiſe the World, that her Majeſty complain'd only of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Undertaking. All the <hi>French</hi> of either Religion, were exhorted in it to relieve their Majeſties in the juſt Deſign they had to puniſh a Crime of ſo dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Common Good of the State. At laſt the Queen proteſted to the Reformed, that Religion not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in this Affair, the Edicts of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould not be leſs exactly obſerv'd. <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornai</hi> was then in a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity: The Town of <hi>Saumur,</hi> of which he was Governor, was in the Queen's way in caſe ſhe went to <hi>St. John d' Angeli;</hi> and Prudence required, that ſhe would aſſure her ſelf of that important Paſſage. <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> did not know which ſide to take: <q>If I fortifie my ſelf, ſaid this Judicious Gentleman, if I call for Succours, they will attack me under pretence of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Beſides, if I don't think at all of being aware beforehand, I leave a place of Security, which I am entruſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to the Diſcretion of our Enemies: Let's run rather the Riſque of yielding to Force and Injuſtice, than augment the hatred they already have againſt our Reformation, by giving our Enemies a new Pretenſion of accuſing us of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55474:192"/>What Crime can they upbraid me withal? I don't fear their Scrutinies, or their Informations; what have they to find fault with me? I have no part in Mr. <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Concerns. Set upon me for Religion! This would be to ſet the whole Kingdom on Fire.</q> 
                  <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to ſtir: He was contented to let the Miniſters of State know the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Conſequence of the ill Counſels, which were given her Majeſty, and to exhort them to let the Reformed enjoy peaceably the Repoſe, which the deceas'd King had granted them with ſo much Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Prudence.</p>
               <p>It had been better to have hearkned to the good Counſels <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> gave, if the Enemies which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe of his own Religion, had not obſtructed it. In the mean time, whether the Regent gave any heed to what the King of <hi>England</hi> had anſwer'd to the Marſhal <hi>Bouillon</hi> upon the Subject Matter of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> or that ſhe fear'd many Provinces declaring for the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> a Civil War might break out in <hi>France;</hi> her Majeſty at laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that if the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had withſtood her Orders with too much Haughtineſs, ſhe likewiſe had too eaſily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way for the King's Authority to be undermined. There was ſought then ſome way to accommodate Matters. <hi>Themines,</hi> Seneſchal of <hi>Querci,</hi> was ſent to <hi>St. John d' Angeli,</hi> to bring back the Duke.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55474:192"/>
                  <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornai</hi> had given him wiſe Counſel, to yield willingly and fairly, as if the Queen was in the Right; provided he kept his Government in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as it was before. The Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſet on foot on that Condition. The former Major was again put into the Exerciſe of his Office, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern Officers, whom the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> would not ſuffer to be in the Town, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred there again: But in few Days after there was a new Election, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent gave other Employments to thoſe whom the Duke did not at all approve of.</p>
               <p>The Reformed Proteſtants after this held a National Synod at <hi>Privas,</hi> in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varets:</hi> They agreed there, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the greateſt Perſons of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was going to make Deſtruction of the Reformation in <hi>France.</hi> The Synod was reſolv'd to make a Reconcilement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them efficaciouſly. They wrote to <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornai,</hi> to join all his Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtneſs and Diligence to that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, which the Company had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to agitate in this important Affair. The Marſhals, <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Leſdiguieres,</hi> not content with the Court, eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Re-union. This made them more formidable to the Regent and her Miniſters. The Princes of the Blood, with whom they were lately confederated, ſhould have had more Conſideration for Perſons who were capable of bringing the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55474:193"/>
                  <hi>Huguenot</hi> Party well united on their ſide. In the Act of Reconciliation, prepar'd by conſent with <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornai,</hi> the Reform'd Lords mutually promis'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all that had paſt; to love one another, to give one another reciprocal Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their Amity, as far as Religion and their bounden Faith to the King would give them leave; to labour jointly for the Advancement of God's Kingdom, and the Repoſe of their Brethren; to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which might prejudice the Union and Conformity of the Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſh'd in the Reformed Churches of <hi>France.</hi> The Dukes <hi>de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> and <hi>de Sulli,</hi> the Marſhals <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Leſdigueres, Chatillon, Soubize, La Force,</hi> and <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornai,</hi> ſigned the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. They agreed further, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of places of Security, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen diſtinguiſh'd in the Provinces, ſhould be ask'd to ſubſcribe the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtation which the National Synod of <hi>Privas</hi> publiſh'd in the Name of all the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> made a great noiſe in the World. See here the Occaſion. The Regent, in her Letter to the General Aſſembly at <hi>Saumur.</hi> had enjoin'd the Deputies to retire into their Provinces, and there make report of the good Intentions of her Majeſty. The Reform'd ſeeing at laſt that this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was oblig'd to break up, before they had time to examine the Anſwer made to their Addreſs of Complaints
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55474:193"/>and Demands, thought to remedy this Misfortune, by convening Provincial Aſſemblies. The Regent ſeem'd to ſuffer theſe, by ordering the Deputies to make their Report in their Provinces. They aſſembled then for this Effect; without that the Court could find any thing to ſay againſt them. The King's Lieutenants had themſelves call'd ſome; and the Preſidents of the Sovereign Court were preſent at others. The Regent had her ſelf given order to the Commiſſioners ſent to examin the Contravention made againſt the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> That they ſhould repair to the Provinces, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aſſembly was held. They were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon certain Occaſions: One can't ſay then, that theſe were held without the Knowledge and Sufferance of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. She thought that ſhe had ſo fully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them as her Commiſſioners had had Orders to aſſiſt there in Perſon; and her Officers, with the Magiſtrates, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of the Eight Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come afterwards to <hi>Paris,</hi> with deſign to finiſh what the Aſſembly at <hi>Saumur</hi> was not able to perform, and to ſollicite more favourable Anſwers to the Remonſtrance which they had preſented, the Regent found her ſelf in a Perplexity ſhe had not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. It is to be confeſs'd, that the way of the Reformed upon this Occaſion was not ill contriv'd. This was a Means to hinder their ſecret and profeſs'd Enemies
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55474:194"/>from gaining ſo great Advantages from the Separation of the Aſſembly of <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi> There was much likelihood that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had furniſh'd them with this Expedient for to croſs the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who had deſerv'd much at Court, by having manag'd ſo well Affairs in the Aſſembly at <hi>Saumur,</hi> as the Regent could not from thence expect a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Iſſue. Theſe Deputations put the Regent and her Council at a ſtand; which was as troubleſom as if the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly had continued. And the Marſhal <hi>Bouillon</hi> did not now ſeem to have done ſuch great Feats. It concern'd him to ſave his Reputation, by ſeeking ſome Remedy for this new Inconvenience. A better could not be found out, than to ſend back the Deputies of the Provinces, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent from People who were aſſembled againſt the King's Will, or at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Permiſſion. And for the Court ſhould not ſcruple this, by reaſon of the Diſcontentment that the refuſal to hear the Deputies might raiſe, the Marſhal <hi>Bouillon</hi> took all the Blame upon himſelf that might enſue.</p>
               <p>They went yet further. The Regent had put forth a new Declaration, which forbid the Reform'd to hold for the future theſe Provincial Aſſemblies. Conſiſtories, Colloquies, Provincial and National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods were only allow'd them, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that none ſhould be there beſides Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Elders; and that they ſhould
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55474:194"/>treat of nothing, but what concern'd the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France.</hi> The Aſſemblies held ſince the Separation of that at <hi>Saumar,</hi> were in very mild Terms declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: And to the end that they who had been preſent there might not be diſquieted, the King pardoned them this pretended Crime, and forbid his Officers from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting any of them. His Majeſty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd they went thither with downright Intentions; and that they had no Thoughts of diſobeying the deceaſed King's Orders. The Reformed were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſurpris'd, they ſhould be pardon'd a Fault, which they pretended to have in no wiſe committed. Their Deputies Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral preſented a Petition to the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for oppoſing the regiſtring of this Declaration. They proteſted, that being far from requiring any ſuch Pardon, their Churches look'd upon it as injurious and reflecting; and that none of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intended to make uſe of it. This Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſtopp'd the Regiſtring of it: But the Court having got over ſome of the Reform'd, under pretence, that they had need of it for their own Security, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was regiſtred and approved of in Forms.</p>
               <p>This Affair made a great noiſe in the National Synod of <hi>Privas.</hi> 'Twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd there, to draw up a publick and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proteſtation, that the Provincial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies had not been held againſt the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55474:195"/>King's Will; and that the Reform'd look'd upon the Pardon, which his Majeſty had granted them upon this Occaſion, as a Reflection which they had not deſerv'd. They declar'd at the end of the Act, that they would never make uſe of the Pardon, which the King pretended to grant 'em, and downright diſavow'd thoſe amongſt the Proteſtants, who ſought for it. As this caus'd great Stirs in ſome Provinces, ſo the Court deſign'd to appeaſe them by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Declaration put forth in Form to explain the former. His Majeſty acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd therein, to be very well ſatisfied with the Fidelity and Obedience of his Proteſtant Subjects; but at the bottom he did not remedy the Miſchief t'other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration had done. The Provincial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies remained forbidden: And this is all that the Court now delivered from the Deputies Sollicitations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

                  </note>We ſhall ſee anon, the face of Affairs wholly altered in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Death of <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which happen'd at the end of the year 1611. But before I enter into this particular, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the following year, I think I ought to ſay ſomwhat of an Affair, which made a great noiſe in <hi>Italy</hi> in the Month of <hi>March</hi> this preſent year. <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> had ſome days agoe ſucced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Vincent</hi> his Father, Husband of the Eldeſt Siſter of <hi>Mary de Medicis.</hi> At this ſame time <hi>Ranutius</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a Plot laid againſt him for above a year ſince, and againſt all the Houſe of <hi>Farneſe.</hi> He thought that he had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Witneſſes to believe, that the Deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duke <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Eſte,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mirandola,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sovereign Princes, had had a part in ſo horrid a deſign. Here's what is diſcover'd now of it. Many Gentlemen, and ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Quality of the States of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Neighbouring places, Conſpired together to kill him, with all thoſe of his Houſe, and to poſſeſs themſelves of the Towns of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi> which they were afterwards to deliver up to ſome Neighbouring Princes, from whom
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55474:199"/>the Conſpirators had receiv'd Money. There's this difference betwixt the true Religion and Superſtition, that the one Abominates the ſmalleſt Crimes, whereas the other can very well accord with the blackeſt Actions. The Wretches who attempted upon the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV were confeſs't, and took the Sacrament afterwards, to prepare themſelves for their barbarous Deſign. They who Conſpir'd a little time after againſt <hi>Ranutius</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and againſt all the Houſe of the <hi>Farneſe's,</hi> ſwore by the Image of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> to keep their Truſt and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one to t'other, and not diſcover their Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Their firſt Project whereby they might bring their Deſign about, was to lay hold of the Opportunity, which the Solemn Baptiſm of the young Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, where the Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> was to be preſent with the reſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. They had reſolv'd to ſlay there <hi>Ranutius</hi> his Children, the Cardinal, and all the Perſons Devoted to the <hi>Farneſes.</hi> The Ceremony of Baptiſm having been happily put off, the Conſpirators not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding continued their Meetings, and took their Meaſures for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Conſpiracy: They had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready got a great number of Men, and ſome Neighbouring Princes were to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with Soldiers at the appointed time. But ſeeing that the Ceremony of Baptiſm was put off too long a time, and that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55474:199"/>the Plot might be diſcover'd, the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators took a Reſolution to ſet up the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in an Abby, whither he had been retir'd to take the Air, and be devout with the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him in this place. They were to come after this was done, to <hi>Parma</hi> in the Night-time, to kill the Dukes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thoſe of his Houſe, to ſack the Palace and City, and poſſeſs themſelves of the Cittadel. Another Party of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices were order'd to make themſelves Maſters, by means of ſome Intelligence of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Placentia,</hi> which they were to deliver up to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all Conſpiracies which require long time for Execution, and a great number of Complices, there's almoſt always ſome one found, who upon conſideration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects ſeriouſly on the Enterprize. The fear of Puniſhment, the hopes of being well rewarded, the Horrour likewiſe of the Crime, and Remorſe of Conſcience, bring them to diſcover the Contrivance. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> happen'd upon ſome Perſons of this Humour, who gave him notice of the Danger he was threatned withal. After an exact Information of all the particulars of the Conſpiracy, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> cauſed a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> to be fixt up in all publick Places, which contain'd the Story of the plotted Enterpriſe, and the Names of the principal Complices, whom the Duke ſummon'd to come and juſtifie
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55474:200"/>themſelves: It appear'd, that the Names of ſome Perſons who were conſiderable for their Degree and Quality, were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs't. <hi>Vincent</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſome days agoe Deceaſed, was ſo well deſcrib'd, as ev'ry one preſently knew him by the Name of <hi>Chief Conſpirator,</hi> which was given him. The Captain of his Guards was the ſecond Man amongſt the Plotters. <hi>Francis</hi> his Succeſſor complain'd aloud, of the injury done to the Memory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this he demanded Reparation. This Affair was ſo much nois'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> inſomuch that they fear'd an open breach betwixt the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The former had his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for whom the Famous <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> had done Signal Services. And the other, the Queen Regent of <hi>France's</hi> Nephew, implored the Succors of that Crown. <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> would intervene for an Accommodation betwixt the two Princes. But t'was ſtrait known, that this Diſquieted Spirit ſought to embroil them further, and rather raiſe a War from whence he hop'd for an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than any ways to make an end of the Differences. The Parties agreed to refer themſelves to the Arbitration of the Duke of <hi>

The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> wrote to his Ambaſſadors in <hi>France,</hi> to tell the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Ambaſſador, that his Highneſs knowing well the Difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Savoy, Charles Emanuel</hi> might not think it ſtrange, that a Daughter of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IV, ſhould be preferr'd before his; but he thought he ſhould receive a ſenſible Affront, if his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty ſhould Reject a Princeſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Son into the Houſe of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Regent ſhew'd ſo much eagerneſs for the Marriage of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as <hi>Edmonds,</hi> Knight and Ambaſſador from <hi>England,</hi> believ'd, that after the way <hi>Villeroy</hi> had ſpoke to him, it might be King <hi>James</hi>'s fault, if this Affair was not concluded, and that <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> would with much willingneſs yield to him all the Conditions he could ask of her. When the King had heard this News, he order'd <hi>Robert Carr</hi> Viſcount of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> his Favourite, to write to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who was then at <hi>Richmond,</hi> and pray him to ſpeak freely,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55474:201"/>if he like'd of the Match. <hi>Henry</hi> had notice that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was not yet nine years of Age, and that her Eldeſt Siſter's Portion was but 500000 Crowns in Gold. <q>But <hi>France,</hi> ſaid <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> ſeems to have ſo great a deſire for this Marriage, as no one doubts, but ſhe may give more to the Second Daughter, in caſe the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of her Fortune be inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>

As long as the Princeſs ſhall be in <hi>France,</hi> the Queen her Mother will be Miſtreſs either to forward the Marriage, or to ſtave it off; and to oblige her Daughter to give her Conſent, or hinder her from it. The younger ſhe is, the more time we ſhall have, and eaſineſs to inſtruct her in our Religion, and Convert her. Since they ask of your Majeſty to Explain your ſelf, as to the Liberty the Princeſs ſhall have in the exerciſe of her Religion;</q> I deſire, you, Sir, to anſwer your Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador poſitively, that you will not agree to any other Conditions with <hi>France,</hi> than what the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, when he offer'd you his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55474:202"/>
                  <q>That is to ſay, that the Princeſs ſhall have the liberty to follow her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in private, and in the moſt Retir'd Chamber of her Apartment. I confeſs, that theſe are too ſtrait and narrow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but if <hi>France</hi> ſpeaks ſincerely, I don't queſtion but that ſhe will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> very well knew his covetous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Humour. For this reaſon, he had a touch upon the Article of her Fortune, in a ſomewhat more nice manner. <q>If your Majeſty, continued he, regards the greatneſs of a Dowry, I think you will prefer the Princeſs of <hi>Savoy;</hi> ſhe brings with her Two hundred thouſand Crowns more than the Lady of <hi>France;</hi> for at leaſt, I can ſcarce perſuade my ſelf, that the Regent will give more to the ſecond Daughter, than to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. But if your Majeſty lays aſide Intereſt, to do what ſhall be more to the mind of the General Body of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants abroad, it ſeems to me, you will rather encline to <hi>France</hi> than <hi>Savoy.</hi> Laſtly, concluded the Prince; I fear leſt your Majeſty ſhould not be content with the indifference I ſhew for all the Propoſitions of Marriage which are made me. I moſt humbly beg your pardon for it. T'is you Sir, who is to take the moſt advantageous Reſolution that may be, for the good of the State. I have but little experience in politick Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can't ſpeak like a Man ſmitten with
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55474:202"/>Love upon this Occaſion.</q> I have with the greater willingneſs inſerted into Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory this Letter, becauſe it might be perhaps the laſt he ever writ. T'was dated the 14th of <hi>October</hi> 1612. and the Prince died the 16th of <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having drank ſome ſmall Beer to quench his Thirſt, after hard Riding, he fell dangerouſly Sick. All the skill of the ableſt Phyſicians, could do no good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violence of his Diſtemper. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was deaf to the prayers of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the recovery of a young Prince Nineteen years of Age, the Hopes and Delight of the Nation. Thoſe Perſons who at firſt affected to ſhew the greateſt grief for his Death, were not ſorry for't heartily. At leaſt t'was ſo believed. The Affliction of the common People was more ſincere, and of deeper impreſſion, than that of the Court. <q>They generally ſaid, the Applauſes which we have ſo hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> have been Ominous and Fatal to him. They who will Reign as abſolute Maſters, don't love to ſee their Children too popular. The Affection which young <hi>Henry</hi> had for Religion, and the Libertie's of his Country, had caus'd the courſe of life to be cut off, which had been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily begun.</q> 
                  <hi>Charles</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Palatine,</hi> who was come to viſit the Princeſs of <hi>England,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd in Marriage for him, were preſent at the Funeral in cloſe Mourning. The
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55474:203"/>Tears of the People who accompanied him to the Grave, in reckoning up his Vertues which ſhin'd already in his Perſon, and in bewailing the irreparable loſs which <hi>England</hi> had ſuffer'd, were the greateſt Ornament of this Ceremony.</p>
               <p>The Prohibition the King his Father made ſome few days after, to appear at Court in Mourning, redoubled the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and indignation of the <hi>Engliſh-men.</hi> Did not he think as a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor did once heretofore, that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Majeſty of a Prince to ſully his Face with Tears, that great Afflictions are for little private Perſons; and that Kings may die, but the State is Immortal. This was the reaſon why King <hi>James</hi> thought he ought not to Interrupt the Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were uſual, at the beginning of a new year. T'was ſaid, that <hi>France</hi> was not ſorry to hear of the Death of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who ſeem'd rather to have the Inclinations of the ancient Kings of <hi>England,</hi> than of the Kings of <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Race; and one could but very badly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Sentiments which the Prince ſhew'd, when he heard of the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <q>I have loſt, cry'd he, my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Father.</q> The common Opinion is, that young <hi>Henry</hi> had reſolv'd to ſteal away from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and go learn the Trade of War under the King of <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as he march't at the Head of his Army. At the ſame time the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> lamented the Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55474:203"/>Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. a Courtier reſolv'd to tell him, that this Occurrence would give his Highneſs the means of making the pretenſion of <hi>England</hi>'s Kings to <hi>France,</hi> more ſtrong and prevalent. <q>Get you gone idle Flatterer, replyed the Prince in Anger; dare you talk to me of making War againſt an Infant? I am ready to defend him againſt all thoſe who ſhall venture to attack him.</q> The Son of that Perſon for whom the Prince had ſo Noble Sentiments, hath not had this delicate Generoſity, though he was much more advanc't in Age.</p>
               <p>I doubt whether it be needful to carry the Suſpitions of young <hi>Henry's</hi> Death, as far as many in <hi>England</hi> have carried them. If it was haſten'd, as the report of Phyſicians made People believe, the Viſcount of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> may have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo horrible a Crime. He and his Wife were accus'd ſince then, as being guilty of Poyſoning. The Prince had no kindneſs for his Fathers Favourite; he always look't ſourly upon him, and ſhew'd a great Repugnance of Spirit to ſuffer him near his Perſon. <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a mean Birth in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found out a way to be Page to the King; his pleaſant Countenance, fine Stature, inſinuating Behaviour pleaſed him extreamly. In a little time <hi>Car</hi> was Knighted; and the King diſguſted with the Count of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> ſet all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Knight. He rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55474:204"/>him up further to the Dignity of Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and afterwards to be Duke of <hi>Somerſet.</hi> The Fall of this unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Favourite was as ſhameful, as his Riſe was aſtoniſhing. He at laſt fell in Love with the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who ſought to engage him; and he afterwards marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. This is not a fit Place to relate this Lady's Adventures. 'Tis ſaid, that the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was ſtruck with her great Beauty; but <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was preferr'd before him. The Deſpite which the Prince harbour'd from hence, encreaſed the Averſion he had for his Rival. The Counteſs having let fall her Glove, as ſhe was dancing, he who had taken it up, preſented it to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> thinking to pleaſe him, in giving him an Opportunity of ſhewing the Lady a Civility, whom he ſeem'd to have a Kindneſs for: But <hi>Henry</hi> threw the Glove back with Diſdain; ſaying, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hath ſtretched it out.</hi> As the Two Lovers were expert in the Art of Poyſoning, ſo, 'tis very probable, they had a mind to be rid of a Prince, and make him away, who would have been a great Impediment to their Repoſe, and the Eſtabliſhment of their Fortune.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> dead ſome Days before the Prince of <hi>Wales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> left behind him vacant Places of great Dignity; the Governments of the <hi>Dauphiny</hi> and of <hi>Normandy,</hi> with the Office of Lord High-Steward of the King's Houſhold. The Regent gave this Office to the new Count,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55474:204"/>Son of the Deceaſed, with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Dauphiny:</hi> She was willing to keep that of <hi>Normandy</hi> to her ſelf, and have it manag'd by a Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was to be ſatisfied, who ask'd for one of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's two Governments. This ſeem'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable, <hi>Conti</hi> having heretofore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up the Government of the <hi>Dauphinate</hi> to the Count. To give him and the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſome ſatisfaction, a Siſter of whom the Prince had married, it was caus'd to be propos'd to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> Natural Son of King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. whom we before call'd Count <hi>d' Auvergne,</hi> and henceforth ſhall be ſtil'd Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> to lay down the Government of <hi>Auvergne. Henry</hi> IV. had put him into Priſon for a Conſpiracy; and the Regent kept him there ſtill. The Marquiſs <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> was ordered to ſpeak to him for accommodating the Matter. The Duke <hi>d' Angouleſme,</hi> who long'd for his Liberty, accepted the Propoſition to obtain his Liberty; and ſo the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was made Governour of <hi>Auvergne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> had vaſt Deſigns rolling in his Head when he died. 'Twas ſaid, that he had bound himſelf in a great Correſpondence with <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales, Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Huguenot</hi> Party. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> perceiving him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with the Regent and her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, ſent to offer him his Services. He did not ask for the Government of <hi>Quille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuf,</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:55474:205"/>but only to be in a Condition of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Entrance to the Succours, which he had projected ſhould come from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> His greateſt Paſſion and Deſire was to remove the Miniſters, and quell the Party of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Epernon.</hi> He would have had the Joy of ſeeing his Wiſhes almoſt fulfill'd, if Death had not taken him hence the firſt Day of <hi>November.</hi> The Marquiſs and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>d'Ancre,</hi> had ſo much prepoſſeſs'd the Queen againſt the Miniſters of State, and eſpecially againſt <hi>Sileri,</hi> that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to keep them in the dark as to her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Affairs. <hi>Galigai</hi> had the Inſolence to ſay a thouſand offenſive things to the Chancellor in preſence of the Queen, and to upbraid him with the ill Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Office. <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> ſuffer'd her She-Confident to ſpeak all; and poor <hi>Sileri</hi> dar'd not to anſwer a Word for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was afraid leſt the Queen ſhould ſecond the Reproaches, perhaps too true, which were ſaid againſt him. The Marchioneſs <hi>d'Ancre,</hi> being ſure of her Miſtreſs's Sentiments, ſpoke confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as ſhe was able to put out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the boldeſt Man alive. 'Tis a Maxim amongſt intereſted Courtiers, not to be put off and repuls'd eaſily, and not to quit the Game, but at the laſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Chancellor went into the Queen's Cloſet with other Miniſters; but there he was afreſh mortified. Her Majeſty turn'd her Back to him, affecting to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55474:205"/>ſpeak with a deal-of truſt to the Preſident <hi>Jeannin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A new Party was now ſet up at Court, which having got the upper moſt, diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the reſt. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The Dukes of <hi>Nevers, Maienne, Longueville,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>d' Ancre</hi> came into it: The <hi>Guiſes, Epernon, Amville,</hi> and their Friends, found their Affairs retarded by theſe Means. The Duke of <hi>Amville</hi> was Brother to the Conſtable <hi>Montmorenci;</hi> in whoſe Abſence, being gone to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he joyn'd himſelf to the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> whom he thought had got further into the Queen's Favour than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Maſter of the Horſe, <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,</hi> of the ſame Party, was then at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> as Governour of it. He receiv'd Orders to come preſently to Court. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legarde</hi> obey'd the more willingly, for that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had haſten'd him to come to their Relief. As ſoon as he had reach'd <hi>Sens,</hi> they gave him notice that the Queen had ſent for him, only to put him out of his Government: Underſtanding this, he went back to it with all ſpeed. The Marqueſs <hi>d' Ancre</hi> had laid an Intrigue for cauſing <hi>Bourgundy</hi> to be given to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were more open Contentions at the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> than at the Court.<note place="margin">The Jeſuit <hi>Becanus</hi> his Book condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits let looſe againſt the lawful Authority of Sovereigns, publiſh'd new Books every Day upon this Subject, to court and pleaſe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55474:206"/>the proud <hi>Borgheſe. Becan,</hi> a famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Society, had printed one this Year,<note place="margin">Mercure Francois 1611.</note> with this Title, <hi>The Controverſie of</hi> England <hi>touching the King and Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> When Doctor <hi>Filezac,</hi> new Syndic of the Faculty at <hi>Paris,</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd it, he ſpoke of it to Cardinal <hi>Bonzi,</hi> to know whether the Queen would think fit the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> ſhould cenſure ſo pernicious a Book. The Nuncio and the Jeſuits ſtrove alike to ſhake off the Blow. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> ſaw that the Faculty would not fail to have a fling in its Cenſure, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority of the Holy Chair. The good Fathers feared, leſt a new Decree of the Faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> publiſh'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>France,</hi> might further confirm the common Opinion, That the Society makes Profeſſion to teach conſtantly a Doctrine, which is contrary to the Authority of Kings, and Security of their Perſons. But the Propoſitions of <hi>Becan</hi> were ſo loudly complain'd of, as it was expedient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe Mens Minds by ſome Condemnation of them. Here's the Expedient which the Pope's Counſel and the Jeſuits reſolv'd upon. They told the Queen, that it would be of greater efficacy to have theſe ſorts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> Cenſure coming forth from the Holy Chair, would carry more Authority with it, than one from the Faculty of <hi>Paris Mary de Medicis</hi> was eaſily drawn into the Snare they had laid for her. She bid the Cardinal <hi>Bonzi</hi> tell the Syndic of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55474:206"/>That her Majeſty would not have the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> to determine any thing upon <hi>Becan</hi>'s Book, becauſe the Queen had a deſign to have it condemn'd by the Pope, the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the good Fathers to make for them this Evaſion. If the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> had left off making a noiſe, the Examination of the Book had been ſtopt. Whatever came on't, the Inquiſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning a Book in general Terms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecifying any thing, People could not exactly know upon what Point the Condemnation fell; and thus the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Propoſition, concerning the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would have been not touch'd or meddled with. It was ſuppoſed, that the Inquiſition never intended to condemn them.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Paris</hi> having preſented in the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> the firſt of <hi>December,</hi> ſome Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons extracted out of <hi>Becan</hi>'s Book; wherein the Aſſaſſination of Kings and Princes was permitted, and many other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, which were contrary to Divine and Humane Laws, the Syndic made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of what Cardinal <hi>Bonzi</hi> had told him concerning the Queen's Intentions. Dr. <hi>Paris</hi>'s Mouth being ſtop'd with this Anſwer, deſir'd, that what he had propos'd, might be regiſter'd; and that a Copy of what the Faculty had concluded upon, might be given him. It was granted him. The firſt Day of the Year following, the Faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> deputed four Doctors to repreſent to the Chancellor, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55474:207"/>to make a publick Teſtimony of their Stedfaſtneſs for the Service of the King, by cenſuring <hi>Becan</hi>'s Book; and to make, at leaſt, the Publick know, that it was not their Fault, if ſo dangerous a Book had not been condemn'd in Forms, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally. They moreover ſaid, that they entreated leave to remonſtrate to the Queen upon this, as an Affair of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance. <hi>Sileri</hi> approved the Zeal of the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> He gloried, that he had all his Learning in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris:</hi> And ſo he promiſed the Doctors to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them into her Majeſty's Preſence, Dr. <hi>Fayet,</hi> who was the Spokeſman, told the Regent, that the Faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> not being accuſtom'd to receive Orders from the King by the Mouth of any private Perſon, or by Letters under the Privy-Seal, but only by Letters ſealed with the Great Seal, they had obey'd, as ſoon as it was reported to them what the Cardinal <hi>Bonzi</hi> had told the Syndic of ther Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Intentions. <q>Nevertheleſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he, the Faculty hath believed it was their duty to receive your Order from your own Mouth. If you don't judge it convenient for us to deliberate upon Jeſuit <hi>Becan</hi>'s Book, we moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat your Majeſty to take care, that our Silence upon this Occaſion be not interpreted as a tacit Approbation of thoſe pernicious Sentiments, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives Kings of their lawful Authority, and juſtifies their Aſſaſſination.</q> The

Pardon then, I pray you, if I require you, by this Note, to ſee you with Sword in Hand, for to have an Account from you of my Father's Death. The good Opinion I have of your Bravery and Courage, makes me hope you will make no uſe of your Quality for an Excuſe to grant me a Requeſt which Honour exacts from you. This Gentleman will ſhew you the Place where I ſhall be with a good Horſe. I have Two Swords, you ſhall have the choice of them. If you won't come hither, I'll go where-e'er you ſhall command me.</hi> The Chevalier <hi>de Guiſe</hi> was in Bed when <hi>du Riol</hi> gave him the Challenge. He quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſs'd himſelf; and taking the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>Grignan</hi> to be his Second, they went all Three to the Place where the young Baron expected them.

The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Guiſe</hi> ran ſpeedily to help him; and <hi>du Riol,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Luz</hi> at Death's Door, made the beſt of his Way. 'Twas ſaid, that the Court Bravo's went to congratulate the Chevalier <hi>de Guiſe</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Atchievement; which, in the Senſe of all reaſonable Men, he ought to be rather aſhamed of. He had barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly kill'd the Father, to rid his Houſe of a Man who was a Thorn in their ſide. Though the Rule of falſe Honour did not allow him to deny the Son the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he required, yet this ſecond Homicide was not leſs Criminal than the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Men, who have a right and ſound Apprehenſion of things. One ſhould be ſo far from applauding this wretched Murtherer, as he ought to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Horror, who after having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly kill'd the Father, was drawn on into the unfortunate Neceſſity of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Son, blinded by his juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hurried on by the Evil Cuſtom of the Times. That which is more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing is, that <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> ſent to viſit the Chevalier <hi>de Guiſe</hi> after this ſecond

               <p>Behold how this weak and imprudent Queen executed the Declarations publiſh'd by her Son, and under her Directions, at the beginning of the Year, againſt Duels.

But the Duke thought <hi>Maria de Medicis,</hi> having her hands full by reaſon of the Factions of the Princes and great Men at home, could not ſend any mighty Aſſiſtance to the Houſe of <hi>Mantua.</hi> And then he hoped to curry favour at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> by means of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> his Friend: Beſides, there were at that time no Troops in thoſe parts; and it would require time to bring them thither: However, he thought the fear of bringing the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> would make the Court of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> backward to declare it ſelf either one way or the other. And this in the very thing, which would have checkt <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> if he had not been blinded by his Ambition.</p>

The Emperors Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in that affair was deſired by him, that ſo he might make uſe of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as there ſhould be occaſion. And he had ſufficiently explained himſelf as to that Point, when he promiſed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver back his Niece into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Modena. Charles Emanuel</hi> laid forth his Pretenſions to <hi>Monferrat;</hi> with as much boldneſs, as if they had been the cleareſt and juſteſt in the World. This is the way of Ambitious Princes. They imagine that the World is eaſily impoſed on, and that Men will believe them upon
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55474:234"/>their Word. As for the Cardinal Duke, he replied in his Manifeſto, that the Dutcheſs his Siſter-in-Law not being of Age, the Law did not allow her to be Guardianeſs of her Daughter, and that Mothers forfeit the Guardianſhip of their Children, when they voluntarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Family and Dominions of their Husbands.

He did not fail to put the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in mind of the Grant which he had made upon the Marriage of his Daughter with the late Duke <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Mantua.</hi> In which Point, he had been guilty of a far more conſiderable Breach of his Word than that was, which <hi>Charles Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> made ſuch a noiſe about: How could he have the Face to inſiſt ſo much upon the retractation of a ſurprized Man, who himſelf was the moſt Perfidious, and falſeſt Prince of his time.</p>

                  </note> Sometimes he propoſed to ſet the Arms of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> over the Gates of all the Towns which he had taken in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and to put them into the hands of his Majeſty, on Condition, there ſhould be a Garriſon of <hi>Savoyards.</hi> Sometimes he offered to let <hi>Philip</hi> III. have <hi>Caſal,</hi> on Condition that the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould remain in Poſſeſſion of all the reſt of <hi>Monferrat.</hi> When he writ to the Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> he did it in the moſt ſubmiſſive manner imaginable; he was ready to deliver up to her Majeſty, all that he had taken from the Houſe of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> perceived that his pretended Submiſſions did him no kindneſs, he put on another Shape; he Hectored and Threatned all the World; Juſt as if all <hi>Europe</hi> had been at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.

But as the Emperor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the ſole Judge of a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie concerning a Fief of the Empire, ſo the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he too, would be the Arbiter without the concurrence either of the Empire or of <hi>France.</hi> All theſe incidents, pleaſed <hi>Charles Emanuel.</hi> What with Criticizing on ſome of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that were propoſed to him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting till the Competition ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, he had time to puſh on his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Monferrat.</hi>

He propoſed to him, that he would blindly devote himſelf to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in oppoſition to all the World, on Condition he would leave him in Poſſeſſion of what he had taken. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, ſo Honourable, ſo Advantageous to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in appearance, were deſpiſed. The Duke was reduced at laſt humbly to deſire, that till the entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Controverſie, he might have one Place left him in token of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to <hi>Monferrat.</hi> They would not enter into any Treaty with this good Prince, but ſent him <hi>Padilla</hi> a General of the Artillery, one of the moſt moroſe Men in <hi>Spain,</hi> who at firſt word told his Highneſs, in Terms very conciſe, and with an Air of ſeverity, that he muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven reſtore all. To compleat his morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>Padilla</hi> produced a Letter of the King of <hi>Spain's,</hi> Short, but Expreſſive, which obliged the Duke to comply with whatſoever the Marquiſs of <hi>Inojoſa</hi> ſhould preſcribe to him.</p>
               <p>Nothing ſo much mortifies an haughty and valiant Prince, as to be treated like a Subject by one that is more powerful than himſelf. But what ſhall ſay? Poor <hi>Emanuel</hi> abondoned of all the Word, was
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55474:243"/>forced to receive the moſt rigid Terms. Inſtead of giving a Poſitive anſwer to grave <hi>Padilla,</hi> he ſent of his Miniſters to <hi>Milan,</hi> with ſuch propoſals, as tended to lengthen out the buſineſs, and delay his Reſolution. <hi>Inojoſa</hi> rejected them with Indignation, and ſent word to <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> that if he did not preſently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all that he had Uſurpt, the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> ſhould lay Siege to one of thoſe Places, which were Re-demanded, that the Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Spot, and hang up every one that dared to Reſiſt him. The Duke knowing no means to prevent it, offered to Surrender and Reſign all that he was in Poſſeſſion of in <hi>Monferrat.</hi> I can't tell, but ſtill he might have ſome little hopes of gaining time, by reaſon of a Quarrel that aroſe between <hi>Inojoſa</hi> and <hi>Caſtiglione.</hi> Each pretended that the Places were to be delivered up into the hands of his Maſter: But <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> who had only the Name and Authority of the Emperor to back him, ſoon complied with the other who had the Power in his hands: The Imperial Commiſſary only received one Town for Form ſake, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the reſt. Never was there an Agreement ſooner Concluded than this, thô the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made a great many Difficulties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would be brought to it. This was the laſt Artifice of a Prince who had

The Marquiſs of <hi>Inojoſa,</hi> being angry that his Colluſion with <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> was diſcovered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared openly, that he would not ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> to have any Soldiers in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor that any ſhould come into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Milan,</hi> that he would give no civil reception to any that ſhould paſs thrô that Province; and if the Two thouſand Men which the Chevalier <hi>de Guiſe</hi> was to bring with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould come thither, he would cut them in pieces. This <hi>Spaniard</hi> was ſo offended at the coming of the <hi>French,</hi> that he Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gallys of <hi>Naples,</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> unitedly to oppoſe thoſe Veſſels which brought Aids from <hi>Provence,</hi> and to hinder the <hi>French</hi> Troops from Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55474:244"/>in the Coaſts of <hi>Italy. Inojoſa</hi> after all, endeavoured to make the Cardinal Duke Jealous, by giving it out, that <hi>Nevers</hi> had a greater deſign to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> than to aſſiſt the Houſe of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke affronted with the arrogance and moroſeneſs of the Governour, told him that 'twas too much in all reaſon, for a Man of <hi>Inojoſa</hi>'s Quality to march with ſo great a Train, but that the Duke <hi>Nevers,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Gonzagua,</hi> might be allow'd to have an Hundred or Sixſcore Men at his Heels. He added, <hi>excepting four or five Friends that are come to me,</hi> all <hi>the reſt belong to me; If the Marquiſs d'I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nojoſa offers to abuſe any of them, I know the Reaſon. As for his threatning to cut in pieces the Troops which may come from France, to aſſiſt the Houſe of Mantua, 'tis not to be rhought that his Catholick Majeſty approves ſuch Language: There's no body in the World can hinder the moſt Christian King from Aſſiſting his Kinſman and Ally, or oppoſing the unjuſt Deſigns of the Duke of Savoy. He would alſo raiſe a ſuſpition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, but I am not afraid that the vain talk of the Marquiſs d'Inojoſa, ſhould make the leaſt impreſſion. My Intereſt is ſo much one with that of the Houſe of Mantua. Monſieur the Governour confirms himſelf the juſt ſuſpicions we have of his Conduct: We know his Averſion to the Cardinal Duke, and we are not ignorant of the Reaſons which he
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55474:245"/>has to favour the Duke of Savoy, agrinſt the Pretentions of his Catholick Majeſty.</hi> Thus it was that the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> ſupported the Honour of <hi>France,</hi> better than the Regent of the Kingdom.

               <p>After the famous Conference held at the <hi>Hague,</hi> in 1611. the States of <hi>Holland</hi> Ordered the Divines of each Side to draw up their Thoughts in Writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Five Articles in Controverſie.

               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:55474:263"/>
               <p>Without declaring for one or the other, the States of Holland publiſh'd an Edict, in which it enjoined both the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants,</hi> Charitably to bear with one another, not to diſturb the Peace of the Churches, not to ſay which had got the better of the other, to ſpeak with a great deal of Warineſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration concerning the controverted Points in their Sermons, to take more care to inculcate upon the People the duties of the Chriſtian Life, and the neceſſity of preſerving Peace in the Church and in the Common-wealth, then to explain to their Auditory abſtracted and difficult Points in Divinity, and whereas the <hi>Contra-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants</hi> complain'd that their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries entertain'd Opinions contrary to the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, not only concerning Grace and Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo about original Sin, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Articles of Religion.

                  <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> had a deſign to make a Law, that the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Miniſters ſhould belong to the Magiſtrates of the Places, but the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy had Wit enough to baffle this Project. A National Synod Convened at the <hi>Hague</hi> in 1586. Ordered that the Paſtors ſhould be choſen by the Conſiſtory, that they would do the Magiſtrates the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of giving them notice of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of asking them whether they found any fault with the Manners or the Doctrine of the Perſon choſen. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Synod overturn'd the Right of Patronage Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Holland</hi> a long time before the Reformation which the States and Gentlemen of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try endeavour'd to retain, as well as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Reformed Provinces. Far from approving this Order the States of <hi>Holland</hi> publiſhed an Edict the ſame Year, by which they declar'd, that their Intention was to reſerve to themſelves and to the Gentlemen the Right of Patronage, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition that they who are Named by the Patrons ſhould not be received into
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55474:265"/>the Miniſtry but after an exact Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their good Manners, and of their ſound Doctrine. Neither did the States of <hi>Zealand</hi> obſerve this Canon of the National Synod at the <hi>Hague.</hi> In the Year 1591. They Convene'd a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Synod of their own Province. 'Twas there Decreed that the Conſiſtory ſhould deſire the Magiſtrates of the reſpective Places to Name certain Perſons from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, who ſhould proceed Jointly with the Conſiſtory in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Holland,</hi> there almoſt every day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſome diſpute when there was a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Church, to be provided for; the Conſiſtory maintain'd that this priviledge belonged ſolely to them: The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and the Gentlemen endeavour'd to maintain their Right of Patronage. But to remedy the diſorders which frequent diſputes about this Point occaſioned, they endeavoured in the Year 1591. in the Aſſembly of the States of this Province, to make a New Regulation concerning the manner of chooſing Paſtors. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Project the Magiſtrates and the Conſiſtory were to Name each Four Perſons of their own Body, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Jointly: The Act of Election was to be carried afterwards to the Body of the Magiſtrates, who ſhould have power to Accept or Reject the choſen Miniſter: And in this laſt Caſe they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55474:266"/>to a new Election. This Law was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable enough to the Civil Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by the new Conſtitutions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> touching the Election of Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters. And becauſe it was convenient to Reſerve ſome Priviledges to particular Perſons, who had the Patronage of Churches; it was added in the ſame Law, that if there were a Paſtor to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to a Church of which a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was the Patron, then this Perſon was to depute Four others to Elect in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Four Named by the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: So that a Gentleman had the ſame priviledge with reſpect to the Church of which he was Patron, as the Magiſtrates had reſerved, with reſpect to the Churches of Towns and Cities. A Regulation ſo well Contrived for the Satisfaction of all the World, met with ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> in the Year 1591. from ſeveral conſiderable Cities, that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to paſs it into a Law.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1612. the Penſionary <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevelt</hi> propos'd a second time to the States of the Province, as more neceſſary than ever, by reaſon of the Quarrels that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe about the Five Articles.

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55474:266"/>and Patrons; this Project had a conſiderable Advantage in the preſent Poſture of the Churches of <hi>Holland.</hi> It allow'd the Magiſtrates to chooſe none but wiſe and moderate Paſtors, and ſuch as ſhould be acceptable to all the World, and well inclined to Peace. When <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevelt</hi> ſpoke in the Aſſembly of the States of the Province, of the Revival of the Law propos'd in 1591. Their Opinions were then decided. Some thought it fit that they ſhould publiſh it; others thought that it was more convenient firſt to have the conſent of the Synode. Theſe latter were apparently afraid that this Law ſhould more provoke the Miniſters of the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrant</hi> Party, who grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled very much that the States pretended ſingly to decide matters belonging to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Government of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> in this Affair, in which he was ſo heartily engaged ſo managed thoſe that were concern'd, that he brought them all over to his own Opinion. The States of <hi>Holland</hi> at laſt reſolv'd, that the Laws which had been Projected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eccleſiaſtical affairs in the Year 1591, ſhould be from that time obſerv'd; but they found great difficulty in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them: There aroſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great Diſputes both by word of Mouth and by Writing, concerning this Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the States. The <hi>Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> ſaid, that the States had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55474:267"/>the Bounds of their Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that it was not fit for them to put their hand to the Cenſor, in Regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrines of Faith, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. The <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> ſide with the States. By this means they had opportunity to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Government, and likewiſe found their account in the Enacting of this Law. The <hi>Armenians</hi> maintain'd, and not without Reaſon, that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> being Sovereigns in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, had power to Eſtabliſh any thing that was not contrary to the Law of God, and to regulate the Government of the Church, to make Laws for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it's Peace, according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſtian Emperors and Princes, which have done ſo before them, without any Contradiction from the primitive Church. So that for the future we ſhall find there were diſputes in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> not only about the Five Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> but alſo about the Right of Patronage, and the Lawful Power of Sovereigns in matters of Faith and Diſcipline of the Church.

               <p>In good truth, theſe Divines and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are a ſtrange ſort of Men. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing things to a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, they are good for nothing, but to perplex them more, when they are left to their Prejudices and Paſſions. What hindred them from giving Peace to their Churches and Country, which their Diſputes expos'd to remedileſs Peril?
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:55474:270"/>only a ponctilio of Honour. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants</hi> did not care to humour their Adverſaries ſo far as to explain themſelves upon certain Articles, and (I know not what) Tenets of <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Vorſtius.</hi> As for the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> they were afraid of giving ground of Triumph to the others, by letting them obtain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance in favour of the Five Articles. For what reaſon ſhould they both refuſe to make an advance which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo reaſonable? With a little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Condeſcention they might have prevented all thoſe Miſeries which enſued. For my part I cannot approve of the obſtinacy of the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. If they ſpoke ſincerely, why did not they ſtop the Mouths of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, by a clear and diſtinct Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Faith? It cannot be denied but that the Writings of <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and ſome others of that Party, give juſt ground of Suſpicion, both to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and to wiſe and diſintereſted Perſons.</p>

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55474:273"/>occurred great Difficulties.

They were forbid to Preach that God made Men to damn them; and that he puts them under a neceſſity of Sinning, and that he invites thoſe to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whom he has reſolved never to Save. Laſtly, the States Ordered that they ſhould not be moleſted, who in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the Doctrine of Predeſtination, ſuppoſe that Men are ſaved by the alone Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, in perſevering in the Faith unto the End, and that all thoſe that believe not in Jeſus Chriſt are damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As for all other Doctrines, the States forbid them to Preach any that was not agreeable to the Doctrines commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Chuches of <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So far was this Edict which was drawn up with ſuch Care to ſatisfie all the World, from Calming the Tempeſt which had ſome time continued, that it encreaſed its Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſome <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> Miniſters wrote Books to perſuade the People not to ſubmit to the Edict.

I have heard it ſeveral times ſaid to the late King, That he never was really King, till the end of the Civil. Wars. Whatſoever they may ſay to your Majeſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of our Religion, believe Madam, that you have no ſuch faithful Subjects as thoſe, who obey from a Principle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. We have at leaſt this Advantage above our Adverſarys, that we acknowledge no power under God, Superiour to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.

I can tell you a far leſs Chargeable way to have all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at your Devotion: That is, to give Orders, that all Promiſes made to us, be

               <p>This Advice was generous and worthy of a truly Chriſtian Gentleman. It might have had ſome good Effect upon ſuch as had no other deſign, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace in the Kingdom, by doing Juſtice and perhaps ſome ſmall gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Reformed. But they were reſolved to Ruine them, and to effect a deſign long ſince contrived and purſued.

               <p>Since the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Newbourg</hi> with <hi>Madeleine</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> there was a more open difference than ever, between him and the Duke of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi> They were Employed in ſtrengthening themſelves one againſt the other, both abroad and at home. Two Paſſions, very blind, but extremely active in the heart of a young Prince, Ambition, and reſentment of an Affront offered him in the face of the World, had inclined <hi>Newbourg</hi> to join with the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Arch-Dukes of the Catholick Low-Countries.

This way of Revenging,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:55474:319"/>which the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> had given him, ſeemed to <hi>Newbourg</hi> the moſt Advantageous and Glorious. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> the 15th of <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Duſſeldorp.</hi> There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, that the Prince deferred his publick Abjuration of the Confeſſion of <hi>Augsbourg,</hi> in hopes that paſſing ſome time longer under the Name of a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> he ſhould the more eaſily effect his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making himſelf ſole Maſter of ſome of the Principal Towns in Diſpute. 'Twas not without Deſign, that being in <hi>Juliers</hi> in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Pitham,</hi> the Governor of the Caſtle, to give him and his Retinue Entrance. The Officer, being a greater Friend to the Houſe of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> than to that of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> refufed to admit him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he would enter alone. <hi>Pitham</hi> relied upon an Article of the Tranſaction which paſſed between the Two Houſes, that the Governors of Caſtles and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Places, ſhould not give Entrance to one of the Princes in Poſſeſſion, unleſs the other were preſent. The Governor remaining firm to his Reſolution, <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> went towards <hi>Leige.</hi> He went to make a viſit to the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> his New Ally.

               <p>The Emperor <hi>Rodolph</hi> had put the City of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> under Interdiction of the Empire, by reaſon of the Change the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party had made in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Aix. la-Chapelle</hi> under Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> in the Year 1611.

The firſt Demands of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Agents appeared Extravagant; but in the end were much ſlacken'd.

One would ſay, that they were going to Inſinuate into us, that Sovereigns have the ſame Reſpect for their Senate, the ſame Honour, which mighty Kings had heretofore for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Old <hi>Rome.</hi> I grant to the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> all that is their due; but I find them far beneath the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> after ſhe had extended her Dominions into <hi>Africa, Spain, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> beſides, Scofft at thoſe Kings, who baſely Crept to them: And I don't know if the Quality of being Eldeſt Son of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> took upon him, be not as unworthy of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as to be a free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:55474:326"/>of <hi>Rome</hi> is unworthy of a Sovereign Poſſeſt of a fair Kingdom. A Prince who intends to make himſelf diſtinguiſht thrô all <hi>Europe,</hi> by upholding ſo bravely his Dignity againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> does it become him to Creep after this manner to the Nobles of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Original is not very Illuſtrious, nor their Independence ſo Ancient? The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had at that time at <hi>Venice,</hi> will know at ſome time or other how to prove this to them. He was the famous Marquiſs of <hi>Bedmar,</hi> whoſe Name will be odious to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> for more than one reaſon.</p>
               <p>When this Miniſter, as jealous as any other would be of the Glory of his Prince, had underſtood what <hi>Piſcina</hi> had ſaid to the Senate from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he Demanded to be heard in his Turn. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſpoke briskly of <hi>Philip</hi>'s good Intentions for the Conſervation of the repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> of the Money he had disburſt, and of the pains he had taken every day to this purpoſe. <hi>The King my Maſter,</hi> ſaid Bedmar, <hi>was in the right to make uſe of the moſt efficacious and rigorous means he could for bringing the Duke of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy <hi>to the reaſonable Conditions, which have been ſo often offered him. The fear which his Majeſty hath of creating too great a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie in the Princes of</hi> Italy, <hi>hath been the only means of keeping him back in this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. We have had all the Patience ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:55474:327"/>All Expedients have been ſet on Foot that were judged the moſt proper to end the difference that hath laſted ſo long a time, betwixt the Houſes of</hi> Savoy <hi>and</hi> Mantua. <hi>If the ſweet Temper and Clemency of my Maſter are of no other Service than to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>more Proud and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, can any one think it ſtrange, that his Majeſty ſhould threaten him, to uſe at this time the Power God hath put into his Hands, and that he ſhould Protect with the force of his Arms the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>who is Attackt with great Injuſtice? The Proceedings of the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>are ſufficiently known in the World, and now he ſees himſelf brought to that paſs, as that he muſt be contented with the equitable Conditions granted him, and break up his Troops, which his Reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition had rais'd to his vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, he laies Intrigues, endeavours to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe unawares the Princes of</hi> Italy, <hi>with a deſign to ſtave off the Compoſition offered him, and avoid the ſhame of diſarming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo great a Buſtle. The Senate hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and pries narrowly into Affairs. They know from a long Experience, the Humour and Diſſimulation of the Duke of</hi> Savoy: <hi>And this is ſufficient to prevent their being blinded by the Artificial Diſcourſe of his New Envoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thô the <hi>Venetians</hi> were more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Charles Emmanuel,</hi> than to the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Miniſters, the Senate avoided the making of any Engagement
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:55474:327"/>with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> They excuſed themſelves from medling with the Affair of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the reciprocal Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Houſes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua;</hi> the Arbitration of theſe things being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Emperor and King of <hi>Spain.</hi> His Highneſs was Exhorted to make an Agreement with the Cardinal Duke, to give Some ſatisfaction to the Catholick King, to yield to the ſtrongeſt, as far as the Quality of a Sovereign Prince would permit him. At length the Senate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to comfort him with their promiſe of doing him all the good Turns they could upon this Occurrency, and not to ſuffer him to be Oppreſt. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> took it ill, that <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Envoy had ſo favourable an Audience at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Anger againſt the Republick, loudly Complained of it. Miſtruſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed on both Sides, inſomuch as the Senate ordered New Levies, and kept themſelves on their Guard, in Caſe there ſhould happen an open Rupture betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> however affected to ſhew outwardly a perfect Neutrality: They diſcours'd like common Friends, who ſtrive rather to be Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, than embrace one Party before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Yet what ever care they took to hide and diſſemble their true Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> would not truſt them.

<pb n="596" facs="tcp:55474:328"/>that they would never ſuffer the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> to bring about his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which he had contriv'd for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Ruine, and to put the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> into an entire dependance on the Catholick King's will.

It's called the Fort of <hi>Sandoval,</hi> from the Name of the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>'s Family. The Governor's deſign was to bridle <hi>Verceil,</hi> cover the <hi>Milanois,</hi> and cloſe up an Entry to Foreigners, who might eaſily this way make an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had for a long time thought on this Enterpriſe, but for fear that ſuch a Novelty might allarm the Neighbouring Princes, the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> let alone their Deſign.

                  <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> after he had ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflected on the Poſture of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, took ſuch a Reſolution as he had been obſerv'd to take upon the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences; and this was to accept of the Conditions which the Nuncio and the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> had propoſed to him. The fear of having all the World upon his back, and the hopes of getting the Mediators to be on his Side, in caſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould make any difficulty of conſenting to the Project of an Accommodation, contributed much to the ſudden alteration, which appeared
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:55474:333"/>to be in the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s mind. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli</hi> upon this, and <hi>Rambovillet,</hi> prepared at <hi>Verceil,</hi> a proviſional Treaty, till ſuch time as a difinitive Judgment was paſs'd upon the Difference rais'd betwixt the Houſes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua. Charles Emmanuel</hi> fairly offered to Sign it. The Marquiſs <hi>Inojoſa</hi> would not do the like. As he had at that time been for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Cardinal Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> with as much zeal as he at firſt had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſo he rejected the Article, which contained in it, that a certain dependance of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> called <hi>Canaveſe,</hi> ſhould remain in Sequeſtration, till the Controverſie upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Pretenſions againſt the Houſe of <hi>Mantua</hi> was determined by Arbitrators choſen on both Sides. The Mediators prepared in the City of <hi>Aſt</hi> another Project of a Treaty, in preſence of <hi>Charles Emmanuel.</hi> The Article touching <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe</hi> in this was left out, and they put into the Room of it, That the Cardinal Duke ſhould pay the Dowry, give up the Jewels of <hi>Maragarite</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> his Siſter-in-Law, at a certain prefixt time, and beſides this, ſhould pay in Two years ſpace the Portion of <hi>Blanche</hi> of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> for which the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> had Conteſted ſo long a time. The other Articles Decreed, That the Priſoners and Places taken on both Sides, ſhould be Reſtored, and that each
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:55474:333"/>of the Two Princes ſhould make an Act of Oblivion, for all thoſe of thier Subjects who had ſerved againſt them.</p>

                  </note> The Cardinal Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was in all appearance to better himſelf in this Treaty; for how could he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the payment of a Dowry, and give up the Jewels of his Brother's Widow?

But the Duke had his reſerve of Friends in <hi>France.</hi> A great many People there cryed out againſt the Pride and Haughtineſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would not have <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> acquitted for Disbanding his Army Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or Twenty days before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Milan.</hi> They pretended, that this Sovereign Prince, whom the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> hated mortally, ought to be obliged to Submit to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Favourites diſcretion, and beg Pardon of his Majeſty, for that he had not obeyed the Orders of the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> without making any Reply. Did ever any one behold the like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance?</p>
               <pb n="609" facs="tcp:55474:334"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inojoſa</hi> careleſly anſwered them who brought him the Treaty of <hi>Aſt</hi> to Sign, That the King his Maſter had but newly forbid him to make any Peace with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Mediators ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this ſudden refuſal, deſired of him however a Suſpenſion of Arms for Forty days, till they could have an anſwer from <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this, and gave them to underſtand, that Winter ſeaſon was already begun, and the bad Weather did oblige him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to grant them what they Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Marquiſs of <hi>Bedmar,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Venice,</hi> made a great noiſe there, ſaying to the Senate, <hi>That 'twas loud Injustice, that the Duke of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy <hi>was not puniſht for his Attempts againſt the Repoſe of</hi> Italy. <hi>Ought not all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, who are Intereſted to preſerve its quiet, unite with the King my Maſter, and Chaſtiſe this Raſhneſs of the Duke of</hi> Savoy? <hi>Carleton,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, kept to another ſort of Language. He ſollicited with all his might, the Senate to declare, that the Treaty of <hi>Aſt</hi> was reaſonable, and that all the diſintereſted Princes believ'd his Catholick Majeſty ought to be contented with it. <hi>Beamar</hi> maintain'd againſt <hi>Carleton,</hi> That this was not the King of <hi>Griat-Britains</hi> Opinion, and that he had explained himſelf in this matter to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſaw, that this
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:55474:335"/>Treaty gave the Catholick King all that he could reaſonably demand. In the mean time, becauſe they would not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoke the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who minded to do them much miſchief, they obſerv'd all poſſible diſcretion in their Anſwers to the Marquiſs of <hi>bedmar. We are very ſorry,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>that the Conduct of the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>has conſtrained the Catholick King to come to ſo great Extremities: But we hope that God will inſpire him with milder Sentiments, and that his Majeſty will Sacrifice a part of his Reſentment, and reſt contented with the Juſtification, which the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>will never be far from giving him. Theſe Civil dealings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments nettled the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they were not diſpoſed to let them take the liberty of Revenge upon the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>according to their own will and fancy, nor humble him as much as they pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave here to make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon theſe particulars. What is the ground of this Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> which makes for Two whole years ſo great a noiſe? 'Twas well nigh puting <hi>Italy,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Europe</hi> in a Flame. Almoſt all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates did concern themſelves in it. The diſpute in the bottom, is but ſome ſmall Sum of Money, or at moſt ſome Caſtles which the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, againſt the Houſe of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  <pb n="611" facs="tcp:55474:335"/>Here's the Reaſon why <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> takes up Arms, overburdens his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jucts, carries deſolation into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which becomes the Theatre of War. The Cardinal Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us as a Perſon of no very ſtrong Head-piece, and guided by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Miniſters, had nevertheleſs the cunning Ingenuity to bring <hi>Spain</hi> on his Side, though at firſt they were againſt him; whether this was an Action of his ability and parts, or an effect of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, his Affair became the Catholick King's buſineſs. But upon what grounds did <hi>Philip,</hi> or rather his Agents, reject the Treaty of <hi>Aſt,</hi> and believe themſelves in the right, for to kindle a War and deſtroy <hi>Piedmont?</hi> Upon a Trifle, upon I do not know what punctilio of Honour. Is't then for this, that Princes imagine they are diſpens'd with, from obſerving the chief Rules of Humanity, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt expreſs Commandments of Jeſus Chriſt? Sad unhappy Condition of Men, if they muſt ſuffer, that they who are ſet over them to ſtudy the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Preſervation of others, ſhould lay waſt Provinces, ruine their Subjects and Neighbours, and cauſe the Lives of an infinite number to be loſt, in ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Vanity, and for the pleaſure of their capricious Humours?</p>
               <pb n="612" facs="tcp:55474:336"/>
               <p>All the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> buſtled after a ſtrange manner, in order to engage the Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> to make a new Irruption into <hi>Piedmont.</hi> They flatter'd themſelves that this Effort would render the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> more Submiſſive and tractable. <hi>Inojoſa</hi> preſt forward through the Reproaches of his Countrymen on all Sides, prepared for ſome motion, but this was ſo ſlowly, as Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles Emmanuel,</hi> had time to prevent the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and enter himſelf into the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Country. The City of <hi>Candia</hi> was taken at this time, and put to Fire and Sword. The <hi>Savoyard</hi>'s Army return'd loaded with conſiderable Booty. The Mediators complained of this Action. But the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> diſclaim'd his Son's proceedings: 'Twas endeavoured to excuſe him by ſaying, that the Prince knew nothing of what was done. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repair'd their loſs, by taking ſome ſmall Places in <hi>Piedmont. Charles Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> a little time after, intercepted a Letter from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Governor of <hi>Milan.</hi> 'Twas there ſeen, that ſome certain Perſons had done ſome ill Offices to <hi>Inojoſa</hi> with his Majeſty: He ſeem'd much diſſatisfied with <hi>Inojo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s Conduct. He was order'd to cauſe his Army to take their Winter Quarters in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and not to agree to any accommodation with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
                  <pb n="613" facs="tcp:55474:336"/>unleſs he did before hand ſubmit to every thing his Majeſty had preſcribed before his laſt motions. <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> did not fail to make this Letter publick: And he found thereby a double convenience, one in mortifying <hi>Inojoſa</hi>'s Arrogance, whom this Letter had ſtrongly cenſured; the other, in making it appear to the Princes, who interceded for a Peace, that <hi>Philip</hi> intended as abſolute a Command over the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> as he had over his Grandees of <hi>Spain.</hi>

                  </note> for fear the Regent of the Realm, ſhould grow ſo powerful as to Dethrone his Pupil, or at leaſt carry away from him a great part of his Eſtate and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The good King thought more of his Family upon this occaſion, than
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:55474:337"/>any elſe: He had not his health ſo well, and his Two Sons in all appearance would be left Minors: Of Three Brothers, whom <hi>Charles</hi> had, Two of them did not want for Boldneſs or Ambition. Having now a Power to declare ſooner, For to ſecure the Crown to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it behov'd the King, to forward their Majority. The Uncles had leſs time to undertake any thing againſt the young King, ſooner than he would Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern of himſelf: Of the Princes who might be miſtruſted, that Perſon might be turn'd aſide from governing Affairs, by other, who were better minded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the plauſible pretenſion of the King's being at Age. That which is ſingular in this new Law is, that he, in favour of whom the Father made it, had need of a Tutor and Regent the greateſt part of his Life. He was out of his Wits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came crack-brain'd and infirm in Body. And this ſad Accident caus'd in <hi>France</hi> all the great Evils which <hi>Charles</hi> V. had a deſign to prevent.</p>
               <p>This very Edict proves to us, that 'tis a long time ſince the Council of <hi>France</hi> ſet themſelves on work, to ſet out pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prefaces at the beginning of their moſt ſolemn Ordinances. <hi>Charles</hi> V. ſaith in his, That the Sons of <hi>France</hi> have ſuch excellent Maſters, ſo good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to inform them, as they become capable of managing themſelves, and
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:55474:337"/>adminiſtring Affairs, much ſooner than other Children. We have ſeen Two Princes under Age in the Two laſt Reigns. Have the Regents had the care to give their Sons any extraodinary Education? Was <hi>France</hi> ſo unprovided of Men of Merit, that <hi>Souvre</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> ſhould be judg'd the moſt capable of inſtructing the young King? <hi>Charles</hi> V. beſides, brought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon, which is no better than this. <hi>God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>who gives Sovereign Power to Kings, never fails to enrich them the ſooneſt as may be with neceſſary Qualities to make uſe of it.</hi> Alas! Let's behold now, how God doth Miracles to enlighten young Princes Underſtandings, and make them more Prudent than other Children? Theſe Gentlemen ſeduc'd early by Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hurried away by their Paſſions, which find no great ſtop in their way, uſually begin later than others, to become rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and oftentimes by a juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon a People whom he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, a King never knows the Firſt Principles of Reaſon and good Senſe.</p>
               <p>According to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Edict, a King ought not to be Inaugurated and Crowned till after the time of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority. But this Formality was paſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in favour of his Son, who had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht this Law. <hi>Charles</hi> VI. was a <hi>Minor</hi> when his Father died, and his Uncles contended amongſt themſelves for the Regency. <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:55474:338"/>to it, as being the Eldeſt of the Brothers to the deceaſed King. The Dukes of <hi>Berry</hi> and <hi>Bourgundy</hi> would have a ſhare in it. The Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Uncle to young <hi>Charles</hi> by the Mother's Side, maintained for his part, that he ought to be call'd to the Adminiſtration of the Government, as well as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Uncles. Some Lords choſen for one Party and t'other, were Arbitrators of the Difference. 'Twas determined, That <hi>Charles</hi> VI. notwithſtanding his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Law, might be Inaugurated and Crowned, Affairs diſpatcht in his Name, and under his Seal; the Dukes of <hi>Berry, Bourgundy</hi> and <hi>Bourbon</hi> might take care of the King's Education, and of <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> his Brother; the Duke of <hi>Anjon</hi> might have the Name and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Regent, but ſhould do nothing, but in Concert with the Three other Princes.

               <p>Searching as carefully as 'twas poſſible for me, what regarded the Hiſtory of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. in his Minority, I oftentimes wondered to find ſo little matter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young King's Education. His Father had made <hi>Gilles de Souvrè</hi> his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. But it ſeems that upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>Henry</hi> IV. leſs thought of chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gentleman who had the Qualities, which this important Employment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, than of Recompenſing the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of an old Servant. I can find out that <hi>Souvrè</hi> beſtirr'd himſelf to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his Family, and procure his Son, the Marquiſs of <hi>Courtenvaux</hi> a conſiderable Office: But I could never learn what he did to give <hi>Lewis</hi> a Royal Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Souvrè's</hi> Family, which this Prince hath made Illuſtrious, did not continue long after his death. The Heireſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all the Means away into another Perſon's Houſe, who was a Miniſter of State, and whoſe Father, of an obſcure Birth, was advanc'd to the chief Dignity of the long Robe.</p>

<pb n="621" facs="tcp:55474:340"/>that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. did not well diſtinguiſh Men of Worth. The Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> uſed many Intrigues to get his Brother into the place of being his Tutour. He offered himſelf to take the care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Dauphin's Studies. Yet <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of his own Inclination choſe <hi>Vanquelin.</hi> He did not long continue in the Employment. The envy and jealouſie of ſome, cauſed him to be removed from it in a years time after the death of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV. <hi>Nicholas le Fevre</hi> ſucceeded him. This was a Perſon noted for his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Piety. The late King had ſent him to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was willing to Recompenſe <hi>le Fevre</hi> in being a means to procure <hi>Vanquelin's</hi> place, in which he behaved himſelf with much approbation. <hi>Le Fevre</hi> died the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Fleurance Rivant,</hi> an able Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician, as 'tis ſaid, roſe from the Office of being Sub-Tutour, to be Tutour in Chief. A Youth who paſſeth through ſo many different hands, doth not uſually become a Man of Abilities.</p>

                  <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. learnt very little <hi>Latin.</hi> Falconry, and the exerciſe of Hunting, pleaſed him more than Study; he lookt very well after Hawks, and became in Hunting, the greateſt Rider in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> ſaith an Hiſtorian, <hi>called to his Dogs in Perfection.</hi> Had it not been much more to the purpoſe, to have taught him, how to ſpeak to Men?
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:55474:341"/>'Twas likewiſe obſerved, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was no bad Gunner, and that he very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Fortification. Theſe Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which might be of ſome uſe to a younger Brother of the Nobility, who is to ſeek and make out his own Fortune, are not in any wiſe fit for a King, if you except from hence, underſtanding and knowledge in Fortifications. He may for his diverſion Hunt and flie his Hawks; but he ought to Employ his time in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that's better, than to be expert in Falcons and Hounds. I ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt <hi>Lewis</hi>'s having ſome knowledge in Artillery, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a King, who ought to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of Commanding his Armies, when the publick-good requires it. But is not this ridiculous, that he is ſuffer'd to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his Memory with the names and uſe of the ſmalleſt things in Artillery? They ought to have been conſtantly inſtilling into his Head Precepts uſeful and important to one who intends to Govern well. In a Pack of Hounds, he could call every one of them by their Names: But tis a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs more worthy of a Prince, to learn the knowledge of Men, to diſtinguiſh from others thoſe who are more capable of Places of greateſt Dignitiy in the State, and to Reward thoſe, who are of good Uſe and Service to the Publick. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. had always good Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Principles in him of Virtue
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:55474:341"/>and Equity: Courtiers dared not ſpeak any thing of obſcenity or Swear in his Preſence. He feared God, loved Juſtice, and was willing to do good to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. If <hi>Souvrè</hi> and others had been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to Inſtruct and Cultivate what God had given him of Judgement and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; they might have done conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service to their Prince and Country. <hi>Lewis</hi> then might not have been in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy neceſſity of leaving all to a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, or Miniſter of State, who did not think of any thing, but the better Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Credit and Fortunes, in raiſing to day a Civil War, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Foreign one.</p>
